### **üéØ What's Been Built**

- **Status Indication**: Via opacity/elevation, not hue switching

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation**
```typescript
// Theme System: /app/frontend/src/theme/oneColorTheme.ts
export const oneColorTheme = {
  screen: {
    shopper: '#0D47A1',   // Blue 900 - Primary
    vendor:  '#1A237E',   // Indigo 900 - Extension  
    business:'#004D40',   // Teal 900 - Enterprise
  },
  on: '#FFFFFF',          // Text/icons on backgrounds
  glass: {
    primary: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.08)',   // Glass overlays
    secondary: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.12)',
    accent: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.16)',
  },
  border: {
    subtle: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.12)',
    medium: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.20)',
    strong: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.28)',
  }
}
```

### **üì± UI Doctrine Applied**

- **Cards/Overlays**: Translucency of base color or monochrome tints only
- **Aisle Widget**: Same palette with lighter/darker variants
- **States**: Rendered by elevation/opacity/shape, not hue switching

### **üé® Live Implementation**

- **Vendor Interface**: Pure Indigo 900 (#1A237E) background  
- **Business Interface**: Pure Teal 900 (#004D40) background
- **Glass Components**: White translucency over base color
