## üé≠ HANDLING Q&A DURING DEMO

### **"How does the AI actually work?"**
**Response**: "Great question. Our AI combines multiple models - sentiment analysis, cultural context, and product matching. I'd love to schedule a technical deep-dive with our AI team to show you the architecture."

### **"What prevents competitors from copying this?"**
**Response**: "Two things - our cultural AI training data and our operational infrastructure. The technology breakthrough is one thing, but the enterprise-grade platform we've built would take competitors 2+ years to replicate."

### **"How do you handle data privacy?"**
**Response**: "Privacy-first design. We analyze sentiment and preferences without storing personal conversations. All data processing follows GDPR and enterprise compliance standards."

### **"What's your real traction?"**
**Response**: "Everything you see is live. $129.99 in real GMV, 12 active users with 100% conversion rate. We can show you the Stripe dashboard and user analytics in our technical session."

### **"How do you scale this globally?"**
**Response**: "That's the beauty of our approach. The AI model scales infinitely, and our infrastructure is built on Google Cloud with auto-scaling. Each new market is a configuration, not a rebuild."
