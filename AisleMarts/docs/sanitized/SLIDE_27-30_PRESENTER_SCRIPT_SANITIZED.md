### **Opening ‚Äì Set the Frame (20s)**

*(Before typing first command)*

> "What you're about to see is not a *concept*. It's not a *roadmap*.
> This is a **pre-built empire** ‚Äî already engineered, already tested, powered by Aisle Intelligence ‚Äî but locked by design.
> Phase 2 is not something we will *build with your funding*. Phase 2 is something you will **unlock with your funding**."

*(Pause. Eye contact. Hands open, then move to terminal.)*

---

### **Command 1: `> unlock seller_portal`**

\*(Terminal returns: `ACCESS DENIED ‚Äì Series A funding required`)

> "Here's the **Seller Portal** ‚Äî the backbone for global vendors, powered by Aisle AI business intelligence. Locked. Waiting. One Series A check away."

*(Lean forward, small pause. Let the lock icon glow.)*

---

### **Command 2: `> unlock logistics_dashboard`**

\*(Terminal returns: `ACCESS DENIED ‚Äì Unlock criteria not met`)

> "This is the **Logistics Dashboard**. Real-time AI-powered supply chains driven by Aisle Intelligence. Built. Tested. Locked ‚Äî until Phase 2 is funded."

*(Look around the room. Hold silence for 2 seconds ‚Äî let it sink in.)*

---

### **Command 3: `> unlock b2b_trade_hub`**

\*(Terminal returns: `ACCESS DENIED ‚Äì Series A milestone pending`)

> "And here ‚Äî the **B2B Trade Hub**. Where buyers and manufacturers connect seamlessly across borders, orchestrated by Aisle AI.
> Locked today. Ready tomorrow ‚Äî with your signature."

*(Glance up sharply. Deliver with precision.)*

---

### **Psychological Trigger ‚Äì The Reveal (30s)**

*(Step away slightly from terminal, voice lower and slower)*

> "Notice the pattern? We are not asking you to *fund the build*.
> The build is done. Aisle Intelligence is already powering 735,000+ users.
> We are asking you to **fund the unlock**.
> The system is live, dormant by choice ‚Äî waiting for this exact moment."

*(Pause. Let silence pressure the room. Then step back to terminal.)*

---

### **Command 4: `> system_status --phase2`**

\*(Terminal displays: `Phase 2 Modules: Seller Portal [LOCKED] | Logistics Dashboard [LOCKED] | B2B Hub [LOCKED]`)

> "Every module. Pre-built. Pre-tested. Powered by proprietary Aisle AI. Locked under **multi-admin authorization**.
> One million downloads achieved. One Series A unlock required."

*(Deliver line while pointing to `LOCKED` status glowing on screen.)*

---

### **Closing ‚Äì Investor Conversion (40s)**

> "You're not investing in *promises*. You're investing in a **switch-flip**.
> Fund Series A ‚Äî and you don't start a journey. You trigger an **unleashing**.
> An empire that's already here. Already coded. Already powered by Aisle Intelligence. Already inevitable.
> Phase 2 is not tomorrow. Phase 2 is **today, waiting for you to unlock it.**"

*(End with direct eye contact. Small smile. Step back. Hands folded. Silence.)*
