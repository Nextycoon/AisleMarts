## 📋 **SLIDE 27** - Terminal Demo (55s)

### 🎬 **OPENING** (0-6s)
> **"Everything you just saw on shopper experience is Phase 1 — production-ready and live. Now watch what 1,000,000 downloads + Series A authorizes."**

**🎯 CUE**: Press SPACE to start terminal animation

### 🚀 **START REVEAL** (6-18s)
> **"These aren't roadmap bullets. These are deployment commands — real system operations that are built and waiting for authorization."**

**🎯 CUE**: As first command types on screen

### 👉 **CATEGORY CALL-OUTS** (18-36s)
> **"AI Storefronts — instant white-label stores. Built."**
> 
> **"Aisle Sales Agent — negotiation-ready, conversion-optimized."**
> 
> **"Logistics & forecasting — automated, hooked into our supply mesh."**
> 
> **"White-label & B2B — enterprise-grade tooling ready to flip on."**

**🎯 CUE**: Point to each section as it appears

### ⏸️ **LOCK TRIGGER** (36-45s) - PAUSE FOR EFFECT
> **"Everything you see is coded, tested, and staged. It's locked, not because it's unborn — because we designed a milestone gate for real-market validation."**

**🎯 CUE**: Make eye contact with lead investor

### 💥 **MIC DROP** (45-55s)
> **"Your Series A doesn't fund building Phase 2. It authorizes deployment. It flips the switch."**

**🎯 CUE**: Gesture to milestone banner, then transition to Slide 28

## 📊 **SLIDE 28** - SQL Evidence (30s)

### 🔍 **OPEN** (0-4s)
> **"Don't take my word for it — verify."**

### 📈 **SHOW DATA** (4-18s)  
> **"Here's a live-style SQL extract from our audit store: downloads, staged unlock requests, and admin approvals. You can see progress (735,421 of 1,000,000). This is auditable — every action, by whom, and when."**

**🎯 CUE**: Point to highlighted rows on screen

### 🛡️ **SECURITY NOTE** (18-28s)
> **"Unlocks require multi-admin consensus — 2-of-N — and are recorded immutably. For investors and auditors, this is governance, not guesswork."**

**BACKUP**: *"We'll share sanitized queries and read-only access to the audit view under NDA."*

---

## 🖥️ **SLIDE 29** - Admin Dashboard (35s)

### 🎛️ **SETUP** (0-3s)
> **"Now I'll show the control plane that executes the command."**

**🎯 CUE**: Lean toward screen

### 📊 **WALKTHROUGH** (3-18s)
> **"The dashboard shows current download progress and the unlock request. Right now we're at 735,421 — the system refuses to proceed until the threshold is met and approvals are complete."**

### 👥 **ADMIN WORKFLOW** (18-30s)
> **"Unlock actions require 2-of-N admin approval. Each admin sign-off is logged. This prevents rogue activation and gives institutional-grade control."**

### 🎭 **DEMO NOTE** (30-35s)
> **"For demos we simulate approvals to show the flow; production requires real SSO + 2FA sign-offs."**

**BACKUP**: *"If our live dashboard hiccups, the screenshots in the appendix show the exact states and logs."*

## 🏗️ **SLIDE 30** - Architecture & Close (40s)

### 🔧 **ARCHITECTURE TOUR** (0-18s)
> **"Under the hood: downloads stream into our event bus, the unlock controller validates the milestone, approval queue in Redis enforces consensus, and PostgreSQL records every action for audit. Deployment runs via our CI pipeline with rollback safety."**

**🎯 CUE**: Point to each layer on diagram

### 🛡️ **COMPLIANCE** (18-28s)
> **"We've built enterprise controls: multi-admin governance, full audit trails, rollbacks, and SSO+2FA for admin actions. This is production-grade, not a demo stunt."**

### 💰 **THE CLOSE - THE ASK** (28-40s) - LEAN FORWARD
> **"So the question changes: this round doesn't fund Phase 2 engineering. It funds activation. We ask for $5M to accelerate go-to-market, unlock Phase 2 once the user milestone is met, and scale instantly. Are you ready to author the flip?"**

**🎯 CUE**: Direct eye contact with lead investor. Pause. Wait for response.

> **"You saw the commands, the proof, the governance. With this funding we go from validated pilot to global scale in 60 days."**

### 🤔 **IF SKEPTICAL:**
> **"I respect the question — that's why we've baked auditability and governance into the system. I'll give your team read-only access to the audit view under NDA and the unlock runbook."**

> **"40% product/ops, 30% GTM, 20% regional expansion, 10% legal/compliance."**
