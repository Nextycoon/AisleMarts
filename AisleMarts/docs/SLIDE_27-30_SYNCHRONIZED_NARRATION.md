# Slide 27â€“30: Synchronized Narration â€” Speaker Notes & Choreography

**Total run (slides 27â€“30 + terminal demo): ~2Â½â€“3 minutes**

---

## SLIDE 27 â€” *Phase 2 Command Interface* (Terminal Visual: commands locked, typewriter reveal)

**Visual:** Terminal UI (black), four sections (AI Storefronts, Aisle AI Sales Expert, Commerce Services, Enterprise Solutions). All commands show `--locked`/ðŸ”’. Milestone banner: **Activation Trigger: 1,000,000+ Shopper Downloads**. Typewriter animation reveals commands one-by-one.

**SCRIPT (approx. 45â€“55s total)**

0. **OPENING LINE (0â€“6s)** â€” Speaker to audience, calm, measured:

> "Everything you just saw on shopper experience is Phase 1 â€” production-ready and live. Now watch what 1,000,000 downloads + Series A authorizes."

1. **START REVEAL (6â€“18s)** â€” Press Space / Start animation:

> (as first command types) "These aren't roadmap bullets. These are deployment commands â€” real system operations that are built and waiting for authorization."

2. **CATEGORY CALL-OUTS (18â€“36s)** â€” As each category types, point to it:

> (Point at **AI Storefronts**) "AI Storefronts â€” instant white-label stores. Built."
> (Point at **Aisle AI Sales Expert**) "Aisle Sales Agent â€” negotiation-ready, conversion-optimized."
> (Point at **Commerce Services**) "Logistics & forecasting â€” automated, hooked into our supply mesh."
> (Point at **Enterprise Solutions**) "White-label & B2B â€” enterprise-grade tooling ready to flip on."

3. **LOCK TRIGGER (36â€“45s)** â€” Pause, eye contact:

> "Everything you see is coded, tested, and staged. It's locked, not because it's unborn â€” because we designed a milestone gate for real-market validation."

4. **MIC DROP (45â€“55s)** â€” Gesture to milestone banner:

> "Your Series A doesn't fund building Phase 2. It authorizes deployment. It flips the switch."

**Visual cue:** After 55s, terminal shows animated locks pulsing. Transition to Slide 28 where SQL evidence appears.

---

## SLIDE 28 â€” *SQL Evidence & Audit Trail* (Table visual: sample SQL output + timestamps)

**Visual:** HD table of SQL query results (download_progress rows, admin_approvals rows). Highlighted entries: `downloads = 735,421`, `unlock_request_id = xyz`, `admin_approval_count = 1/2`.

**SCRIPT (approx. 25â€“35s)**

1. **OPEN (0â€“4s)** â€” Calm:

> "Don't take my word for it â€” verify."

2. **SHOW THE DATA (4â€“18s)** â€” Point to highlighted rows:

> "Here's a live-style SQL extract from our audit store: downloads, staged unlock requests, and admin approvals. You can see progress (735,421 of 1,000,000). This is auditable â€” every action, by whom, and when."

3. **SECURITY NOTE (18â€“28s)** â€” Reassuring tone:

> "Unlocks require multi-admin consensus â€” 2-of-N â€” and are recorded immutably. For investors and auditors, this is governance, not guesswork."

**Backup line if audience asks about authenticity:**

> "We'll share sanitized queries and read-only access to the audit view under NDA."

**Visual cue:** Highlight `admin_approval` row, then animate arrow to Slide 29.

---

## SLIDE 29 â€” *Admin Dashboard Demo (Live or Screenshots)* (UI: pending approval state showing 1/2 admins approved, progress bar at 73.5%)

**Visual:** Admin panel screenshot or live demo. Controls: progress bar, unlock request, Approve (grayed for demo), Audit log viewer.

**SCRIPT (approx. 30â€“40s)**

1. **SETUP (0â€“3s)** â€” Lean into screen:

> "Now I'll show the control plane that executes the command."

2. **WALKTHROUGH (3â€“18s)** â€” Click / highlight: downloads progress, pending approval:

> "The dashboard shows current download progress and the unlock request. Right now we're at 735,421 â€” the system refuses to proceed until the threshold is met and approvals are complete."

3. **ADMIN WORKFLOW (18â€“30s)** â€” Point to approvals panel:

> "Unlock actions require 2-of-N admin approval. Each admin sign-off is logged. This prevents rogue activation and gives institutional-grade control."

4. **DEMO OPTION (30â€“40s)** â€” If doing live demo, show simulated: first admin approved, second pending; **do not** press unlock unless staging.

> "For demos we simulate approvals to show the flow; production requires real SSO + 2FA sign-offs."

**Backup transition if network fails:**

> "If our live dashboard hiccups, the screenshots in the appendix show the exact states and logs â€” full auditability is included in the due-diligence pack."

**Visual cue:** Show the Approve queue then move to Slide 30 architecture.

---

## SLIDE 30 â€” *Infrastructure Architecture & Closing Ask* (Diagram visual: Redis queue, Postgres audit, Unlock controller, Kubernetes + admin UI; compliance badges)

**Visual:** Clean infra diagram + compliance badges (2FA, SSO, Audit-ready), callout: **Activation Sequence** steps (1. threshold check, 2. multi-admin approval, 3. deployment runbook).

**SCRIPT (approx. 30â€“40s)**

1. **ARCHITECTURE TOUR (0â€“18s)** â€” Point to each layer:

> "Under the hood: downloads stream into our event bus, the unlock controller validates the milestone, approval queue in Redis enforces consensus, and PostgreSQL records every action for audit. Deployment runs via our CI pipeline with rollback safety."

2. **COMPLIANCE & RISK (18â€“28s)** â€” Reassuring tone:

> "We've built enterprise controls: multi-admin governance, full audit trails, rollbacks, and SSO+2FA for admin actions. This is production-grade, not a demo stunt."

3. **THE CLOSE â€” THE ASK (28â€“40s)** â€” Lean forward, decisive:

> "So the question changes: this round doesn't fund Phase 2 engineering. It funds activation. We ask for **$5M** to accelerate go-to-market, unlock Phase 2 once the user milestone is met, and scale instantly. Are you ready to author the flip?"

**Visual cue:** Slide shows big "Authorize Phase 2" CTA (for theatrical gesture only; do not press).

## POST-DEMO: Variants & Backup Lines (use depending on investor reaction)

### If investors are visibly impressed / leaning forward:

> "You saw the commands, the proof, the governance. With this funding we go from validated pilot to global scale in 60 days."

### If skeptical about feasibility:

> "I respect the question â€” that's why we've baked auditability and governance into the system. I'll give your team read-only access to the audit view under NDA and the unlock runbook."

### If they ask about cost breakdown for $5M:

> Brief breakdown (one-liner):
> "40% product/ops, 30% GTM, 20% regional expansion, 10% legal/compliance."

### If demo tools fail (network, animation fails):

> Backup: "We have a recorded video of the exact same flow â€” we'll play it now." â†’ play pre-recorded 90s clip of terminal demo + admin approvals. Continue to Slide 28 content.

## PRACTICAL STAGE DIRECTIONS & TIMING SUMMARY

* **Start Slide 27:** press Space/Start animation. (Total ~55s)
* **Transition Slide 28:** SQL evidence (25â€“35s)
* **Transition Slide 29:** Admin dashboard walkthrough (30â€“40s)
* **Transition Slide 30:** Architecture + Close (30â€“40s)
* **Total expected runtime:** ~2:30 â€“ 3:00 minutes

**Timing tip:** pace your sentences; pause 1.0â€“1.5s after each lock reveal. Let the room absorb the visual lock â€” that pause is the psychological lever.

---

## PRESENTER VOICE & BODY LANGUAGE NOTES (short)

* **Voice:** Confident, measured, slightly slower than normal speech (so visuals land).
* **Pacing:** Use micro-pauses (0.6â€“1s) at punctuation; longer pauses (1.5â€“2s) after the "flip the switch" line.
* **Eyes:** Alternate between terminal, investor(s), and slide â€” don't stare at the screen.
* **Gestures:** Use one open-hand gesture when saying "we built it," and point at the milestone banner when saying "1,000,000 downloads."
* **Closure:** End on the ask line with direct eye contact to the lead investor.

## PRODUCTION CHECKLIST (before the demo)

1. Staging: Ensure terminal animation is cached locally (avoid live network dependency).
2. Preload: Append pre-recorded backup video to deck (Slide 29 backup).
3. Admin demo: Use simulated staging credentials for approvals (do not use production keys).
4. NDA: Prepare NDA/read-only audit access link for investor technical teams.
5. Role cues: Assign one team member to handle technical Q&A post-demo.
