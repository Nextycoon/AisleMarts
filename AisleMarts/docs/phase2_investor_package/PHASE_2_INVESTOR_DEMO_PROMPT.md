## üéØ **DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT**

### **Opening (5 minutes)**
"Today we're showing you AisleMarts v1 - our live luxury shopping platform with 735K+ downloads. But what makes this Series A unique is what you're about to see: a complete Phase 2 business ecosystem that's already built, tested, and waiting for unlock."

### **Phase 2 Reveal (10 minutes)**  
"Here's our seller dashboard, inventory management, B2B marketplace - all production-ready. Notice the lock overlays? This isn't vaporware. It's a strategic choice. We're proving shopper focus first, then expanding from strength."

### **Technical Deep Dive (10 minutes)**
"Let me show you our unlock authorization system. Multi-admin approval, PostgreSQL audit trails, enterprise compliance. When we hit 1M downloads and close Series A, this button activates a pre-built empire, not a development roadmap."

### **Strategic Close (5 minutes)**
"Most startups ask for funding to build features. We're asking for funding to unlock an ecosystem. The technical risk is eliminated. The market validation is clear. The question is: do you want to own a piece of the commerce future?"
