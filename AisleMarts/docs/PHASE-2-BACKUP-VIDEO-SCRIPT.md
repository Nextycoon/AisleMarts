## 🎬 **90-SECOND SCRIPT**

### **OPENING** (0-10s)
*[Visual: AisleMarts v1 shopper interface]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "AisleMarts v1 - our live luxury shopping experience with 735,000+ downloads. But what you're about to see is what Series A unlocks."

### **PHASE 2 REVEAL** (10-35s)  
*[Visual: Terminal interface fading in, commands typing]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Phase 2 isn't a roadmap - it's already built. AI Storefronts. Aisle Sales Agents. Logistics optimization. B2B marketplaces. Every command you see represents months of completed development work."

*[Visual: Each command section highlights as mentioned]*

### **LOCK DEMONSTRATION** (35-55s)
*[Visual: Lock icons pulsing, "ACCESS DENIED" messages]*

**VOICEOVER:**  
> "These features are locked by design. Not because they're unfinished - because we built milestone gates. 1 million downloads plus Series A funding authorizes deployment. We're not asking you to fund building Phase 2. We're asking you to fund unlocking it."

### **EVIDENCE PROOF** (55-75s)
*[Visual: SQL audit tables, admin dashboard]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Multi-admin approval system. PostgreSQL audit trails. Enterprise governance. When you invest, you don't start a development timeline - you trigger a deployment sequence."

### **CLOSING** (75-90s)
*[Visual: "Authorize Phase 2" button highlighted]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Phase 2 is ready. The infrastructure is proven. The empire is built and waiting. Your Series A is the unlock key. Are you ready to author the flip?"
