# 📱 AisleMarts Mobile Permissions Testing Guide

## 🎯 **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED!**

**Problem:** Permissions weren't responding in web browser preview
**Solution:** Native permissions only work on real mobile devices!

## 🔧 **HOW TO TEST PERMISSIONS ON MOBILE**

### Method 1: Expo Go App (Recommended)
1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. **Scan QR Code** from the Expo development server
   - The QR code is displayed in your terminal/browser
   - Open Expo Go app and scan the QR code
   - App will load on your mobile device

3. **Test Permissions** - Now the permissions will work properly:
   - ✅ Microphone permission will show native iOS/Android dialog
   - ✅ Camera permission will show native permission dialog
   - ✅ Location permission will show native dialog
   - ✅ Photo library permission will work
   - ✅ Notifications permission will work

### Method 2: Development Build
