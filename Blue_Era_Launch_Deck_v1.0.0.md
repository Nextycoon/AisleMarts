## 📊 SLIDE 2: The Problem

The Problem: Commerce Feels Robotic

❌ Cold, transactional experiences = 70% cart abandonment
❌ Generic error messages = frustrated users
❌ One-size-fits-all = no personal connection

"It works... but it feels robotic."

BEFORE: "Payment Failed. Error Code: 500_PAYMENT_DECLINED"
AFTER: "Don't worry! Let's find another way to get this to you. 💙"
```
