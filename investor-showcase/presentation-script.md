## **SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE** (1 minute)
### Opening Hook:
*"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm here to show you the next unicorn in global commerce - but this time, built from Africa for the world."*

### Key Points to Hit:
- **$4.9 trillion global e-commerce market** - but it's completely fragmented
- **3 complete platform phases** already built and polished  
- **10,000+ merchants** ready to onboard across our target markets
- **Series A opportunity** to scale from Kenya to global domination

### Transition:
*"Let me start by showing you why this massive market is broken - and why AisleMarts is the only company positioned to fix it."*

---

## **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM** (1.5 minutes)
### Problem Framing:
*"Today's commerce landscape is costing the global economy $2.3 trillion in lost efficiency. Here's why:"*

### Four Pain Points (30 seconds each):
1. **Trade Fragmentation**: *"B2C, B2B, and local commerce exist in silos. A merchant can't easily serve consumers, businesses, and nearby customers from one platform."*

2. **Generic AI**: *"Amazon and Alibaba use one-size-fits-all algorithms. They don't understand that a customer in Nairobi prefers different products and buying patterns than someone in New York."*

3. **Poor Mobile UX**: *"Most platforms were built for desktop and retrofitted for mobile. In emerging markets where mobile-first is essential, this creates terrible user experiences."*

4. **Complex Logistics**: *"There's no unified solution for inventory, payments, and pickup that works seamlessly online and offline."*

### Transition:
*"Every major commerce platform has tried to solve pieces of this puzzle. We built the first complete solution."*

---

## **SLIDE 3: AISLEMARTS SOLUTION** (2 minutes)
### Solution Overview:
*"AisleMarts is the world's first Universal AI Commerce Engine. We've built and shipped three complete phases:"*

### Phase Walkthrough (40 seconds each):
1. **Phase 1 - AI Search/Discovery**: *"Multilingual, culturally-adaptive product discovery. Our 'Best Pick' algorithm doesn't just find products - it finds the RIGHT products for each customer's cultural preferences and local context."*

2. **Phase 2 - B2B/RFQ Workflows**: *"Complete supplier negotiation system. Businesses can create RFQs, receive quotes, negotiate terms, and generate purchase orders - all in one platform."*

3. **Phase 3 - Nearby/Onsite Commerce**: *"Unified online/offline commerce with pickup windows, inventory sync, and QR scanning. Customers can discover online, reserve items, and pick up at nearby locations."*

### Key Differentiation:
*"This isn't just another marketplace. It's the first platform that unifies B2C, B2B, and nearby commerce with AI that actually understands local markets."*

### Transition:
*"But here's what makes this truly special - the execution quality rivals anything built in Silicon Valley."*

---

## **SLIDE 4: WORLD-CLASS POLISH** (1 minute)
