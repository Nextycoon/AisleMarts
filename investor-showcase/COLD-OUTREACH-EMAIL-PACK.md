Hi [Investor Name],

As an investor focused on African innovation, you'll appreciate what we've built with AisleMarts - the first Universal AI Commerce Engine designed for emerging markets from day one.

• All phases production-ready with world-class mobile UX

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
• 2025: Kenya + East Africa expansion ($2.1B market)
• 2026: Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt entry ($8B+ market)
• 2027: Continental scale with cultural AI advantage

Hi [Investor Name],

TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE:
• 3 complete platform phases with world-class engineering
• Accessibility features for inclusive commerce (screen readers, haptic feedback)
• Multi-language support with proper cultural context
• Open API architecture for regulatory compliance

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
• $4.9T global market with focus on sustainable, inclusive growth
• Emerging market expansion with respect for local culture
• European market entry with regulatory compliance advantage
• B-Corp consideration for responsible business certification

SERIES A: €4.5M for responsible global expansion and European market entry

We're building commerce technology that aligns with European values while achieving global scale.

Demo available this week to show our responsible AI approach in action.
