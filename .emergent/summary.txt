The AI engineer systematically developed the AisleMarts application, progressing from a core MVP to advanced AI and geographic features, including global payments (Phase 2C) and an AI Search Hub. Following a massive new specification for ALL modules (AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, AI User Agents, etc.), the engineer methodically created backend models, services, and routes, along with corresponding frontend components. Initial backend testing revealed and fixed an issue with the AI User Agents Framework. The frontend was then fully developed, including services, screens, and navigation integrations. Subsequently, a comprehensive master specification was uploaded, leading to a strategic decision to prioritize the remaining three core enterprise documentation features (Documentation Compliance, Procedures by Category, Documentation Procedures) over new Ads and Shoppable Video modules, deeming them critical for B2B credibility. The engineer has actively commenced implementing these documentation features, creating the initial models, services, and routes.

The overarching goal is AisleMarts, a cross-platform, AI-powered global marketplace designed for both B2C and B2B transactions.
1.  **MVP:** Basic marketplace features (products, categories, vendors, cart, checkout, orders, payments).
2.  **Phase 2A - AI Core Features:** Personal AI agent system, intelligent onboarding/localization, multi-modal search (voice, image, barcode), real-time translation, AI matchmaking.
3.  **Phase 2B - Seller Visibility & Geographic Targeting:** AI-powered geographic intelligence for sellers to manage product visibility (local/national/global).
4.  **Phase 2C - Global Payments & Tax Engine:** Regional payment optimization and smart tax calculations.
5.  **AI Search Hub:** Unified, multi-modal AI search (voice, image OCR, QR/barcode, quick/deep search) with user-controlled tools, localization, and accessibility, integrated into the home screen.
6.  **Comprehensive Enterprise Features:**
    *   **AI Domain Specialization:** E-commerce/global trade AI.
    *   **Auth Identity:** Advanced verification, trust badges, username/image policies.
    *   **Profile Card:** Unified user/profile cards.
    *   **Documentation Compliance:** International trade document management.
    *   **Procedures by Category:** Role-specific workflows for companies/brands vs. buyers/visitors.
    *   **Documentation Procedures:** Document states, amendments, approval workflows.
    *   **AI User Agents:** Dedicated, customizable AI agents for end-to-end tasks.
7.  **New Features (from master specification):** Ads Platform (self-service advertising system) and Shoppable Video (video-first product discovery with reels).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully implemented and integrated several core Comprehensive Enterprise Features into AisleMarts. This includes the full backend and frontend development for AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, and AI User Agents. Backend development involved creating all necessary models, services, and API routes, with a specific fix addressing issues identified in the AI User Agents Framework. The frontend integration encompassed creating dedicated services, screens, and updating the application's navigation, primarily via the profile screen, to include these new features with NEW badges.

Following this, a comprehensive master specification was provided, leading to a strategic pivot. The current, immediate focus is on implementing Phase 1 - Enterprise Core, which involves the documentation suite. Work has commenced on this, and the engineer has already created the following backend files:
- 
- 
- 
- 

The project is now at the point of completing the backend for these critical documentation features.
