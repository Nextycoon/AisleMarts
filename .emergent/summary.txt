The trajectory details the evolution of the AisleMarts application from an AI-First Transformation to a Multi-Vendor System and finally a comprehensive Operational Intelligence Ecosystem. Initially, the AI engineer ensured the core AI-First UI and backend services (localization, seller onboarding, commission, M-Pesa, multi-language AI) were functional, as summarized in Chat Message 1.

The current AI engineer then validated this foundation, resolving minor UI path ambiguities and confirming backend API health. Following this, Phase 1 focused on building an Enhanced Seller Dashboard, integrating new backend APIs for product/order management and a polished frontend with image/variant support, commission tracking, and M-Pesa details. Phase 2 expanded this to a full Order Management System, incorporating seller/buyer order flows and M-Pesa webhooks, achieving 100% backend test success.

The final, extensive work involved creating a sophisticated operational intelligence stack: a real-time Monitoring Dashboard (MongoDB-integrated, pre-wired), a Week-1 Pilot Log Kit (Google Sheets for structured human intelligence), a Week-2 Smart Alert Framework (data-driven, multi-channel notifications), and a Day-8 Threshold Update Playbook for seamless transition. This was complemented by an Ops Team Training One-Pager and a complete Visual Communication Suite (design specs, wireframes) for an all-in-one Master Bundle. The mission concluded with the creation of  and  files for the bundle, signifying a world-class, deployment-ready operational system for the Kenya pilot and global expansion.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace, designed to overcome global trade fragmentation using AI-driven logistics and human-centric commerce. Initially, the application focused on core marketplace functionalities and a Documentation Suite, later integrating the Blue Era Empathy System with the AI avatar Aisle. This system provided a Blue Era Dashboard including Aisle Avatar, Welcome/Role Selection, Product Reels, Quick Access Dock, and Empathy Automation.

The current development expanded this into an AisleMarts Unified Global Marketplace App. Key requirements included an AI Agent (Aisle Character), Automatic Localization (currency, language, location), Global Marketplace Integration (seller onboarding, 1% commission, M-Pesa), and the full integration of the Blue Era Dashboard. The project's MVP roadmap included Phase 1 for authentication, basic AI, product browsing, localization, and a Blue Era prototype, followed by Phase 2 for full backend integration, trust scoring, video reels, AI personalization, and national franchise integration. The most recent work explicitly focused on enhancing multi-vendor capabilities crucial for the Kenya pilot, including a comprehensive seller dashboard and order management.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer's direct coding and framework generation tasks for the AisleMarts application are complete. Pending tasks mostly involve human execution or future phases:
- Execute Kenya pilot user testing.
- Conduct seller recruitment and localized advertising campaigns.
- Design Phase 3 analytics based on real pilot usage data.
- Integrate specific API keys for Slack/Email/SMS into the alert framework.
- Render visual assets (poster, infographic) from provided design specifications.
- Adapt operational intelligence bundle for other markets (UAE, Egypt, Saudi).

<current_work>
Immediately before the conclusion of this trajectory, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive Operational Intelligence Master Bundle for the AisleMarts application. This involved a series of deliverables designed to ensure a robust, monitored, and scalable launch for the Kenya pilot:

1.  **Pilot Monitoring Dashboard Kit**: A deployable ZIP containing a FastAPI backend (pre-wired to existing MongoDB) and a Next.js frontend. It featured three core dashboards: Orders Overview, M-Pesa Success Rate, and Commission Tracker, all displaying real-time KES data with auto-refresh and mobile responsiveness.

2.  **Week-1 Pilot Log Kit**: A ZIP containing CSV templates, a Google Sheets implementation guide, and formulas. This enabled structured human data collection for anomalies, patterns, and baseline establishment during the initial pilot phase.

3.  **Week-2 Smart Alert Kit**: A deployable ZIP with YAML configuration files, Python handlers, and an alert engine. This framework automates proactive monitoring with data-driven thresholds, multi-channel notifications (Slack, Email, SMS), and intelligent escalation logic.

4.  **Day-8 Transition Playbook**: A detailed Markdown guide for seamlessly updating alert thresholds with Week-1 collected data.

5.  **Ops Team Training One-Pager**: A simplified Markdown guide for non-technical operations staff to execute the Day-8 transition confidently.

6.  **Visual Communication Suite**: Comprehensive design specifications, desktop and mobile ASCII wireframe blueprints, and color/typography standards (provided as Markdown files) for creating an infographic poster.

7.  **Master Bundle Integration**: All aforementioned deliverables were consolidated into a Master Deployment Guide (Markdown) providing an overview, deployment sequence, team assignments, success checklist, and global scaling protocol. This guide was then delivered in both PDF and editable Word formats. Finally, the AI engineer provided a  and  to be placed at the root of a ZIP archive for self-explanatory distribution.

The mission concluded with the explicit agreement that the operational intelligence masterpiece was complete, deployment-ready, and set for the Kenya pilot and global scaling, with the final deliverable being the content for the .
