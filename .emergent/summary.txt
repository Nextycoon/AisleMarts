The trajectory details the evolution of the AisleMarts application from a Kenya pilot launch to a Universal AI Commerce Engine. Initially, the focus was on a world-class UX transformation for Kenya, including mobile optimization, M-Pesa, and multi-language AI, which was successfully completed. The subsequent work, handled by the current AI engineer, expanded the application through two major phases: Enhanced AI Search/Discovery (Phase 1) and B2B/RFQ Workflows (Phase 2). Both phases involved significant backend development (FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis) and frontend implementation (Expo/React Native) with detailed blueprints and iterative testing. Currently, Phase 1 and 2 are functionally complete and await user acceptance testing. The AI engineer is now tasked with drafting a blueprint for Phase 3: Nearby/Onsite Commerce, to continue the strategic build momentum while UAT is pending.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts aims to be an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace, addressing global trade fragmentation with AI-driven logistics and human-centric commerce. Core features include an AI Agent, automatic localization (currency, language, location), and multi-marketplace integration with seller onboarding, 1% commission, and M-Pesa. The Blue Era Dashboard with AI avatar and product reels is a key component. The Kenya pilot launch focused on multi-vendor capabilities, mobile optimization, UX, and cultural integration, achieving world-class experience.

Current implementation expands this to a Universal AI Commerce Engine with:
- **Phase 1: Enhanced AI Search/Discovery**: Multilingual search, offer de-duplication, Best Pick algorithm (price, ETA, trust, cultural fit), image/barcode search, Redis caching.
- **Phase 2: B2B/RFQ Workflows**: Create, manage, negotiate Request-for-Quotes (RFQs), supplier quotes, negotiation threads, and Purchase Order (PO) creation.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis, Pydantic, REST APIs.
- **Frontend:** Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Expo Router, Axios, Zod.
- **AI:** LLM-powered discovery, cultural AI ranking, intent detection.
- **Concepts:** File-based routing, modular architecture, localization, performance optimization, offline resilience, B2B workflows, geospatial capabilities.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo-like structure within , separating  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native).


**File Descriptions & Changes:**
-   : Defines the data structures for products, offers, and merchants used in the enhanced search.
-   : Contains the logic for processing search queries, including MongoDB aggregation pipelines for de-duplication, ranking, and multilingual support.
-   : Manages caching search results using Redis to improve performance.
-   : Exposes the enhanced search functionality via FastAPI endpoints.
-   : Defines the data models for the Request-for-Quote (RFQ) system, including RFQs, quotes, negotiation messages, and purchase orders.
-   : Implements the business logic for managing the RFQ lifecycle.
-   : Provides the API endpoints for creating, managing, and interacting with RFQs, quotes, and purchase orders.
-   : The main FastAPI application file, updated to include the new search and RFQ API routes and initialize the Redis client.
-   : Frontend client to interact with the enhanced search backend.
-   : New React Native component to display the Best Pick badge on product cards.
-   : Component for comparing different offers for a product.
-   , , : Reusable UI components for the B2B section.
-   : Modified to add a navigation button to the new  screen.
-   : Updated to register the new  route and integrate global navigation elements.
-   : The primary screen for the enhanced AI-powered search and discovery.
-   : Dashboard for buyers to view and manage their RFQs.
-   : Screen for creating new RFQs with multiple items and specifications.
-   : Screen for managing quotes received for a specific RFQ, including comparison and acceptance.
-   : Interface for real-time negotiation with suppliers.
-   : Tracker for purchase orders created from accepted quotes.
-   : Centralized Axios instance for frontend API calls, configured with the base URL.
-   : API client functions specifically for B2B RFQ-related endpoints.
-   : TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas defining the data models for the B2B frontend, mirroring the backend.

<pending_tasks>
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Phase 1 (Enhanced Search/Discovery) and Phase 2 (B2B/RFQ Workflows).
- Develop a blueprint for Phase 3: Nearby/Onsite Commerce (location-based discovery, reserve & pickup, QR/barcode scanning, live inventory).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of Phase 1 (Enhanced AI Search/Discovery) and Phase 2 (B2B/RFQ Workflows) for the Universal AI Commerce Engine.

**Phase 1:**
- **Backend:** New FastAPI models, services, and routes (, ) were created for multilingual search, offer de-duplication, and Best Pick scoring. Redis caching was integrated to improve search performance. Backend tests showed a 93.3% success rate.
- **Frontend:** A new  screen was implemented in Expo React Native, featuring a global search bar, Retail/Wholesale/All filters, Best Pick badges, and an Offers Sheet for product comparison. A Discover button was added to  for navigation. Frontend automated tests reported 100% mobile UX success, and UI screenshots confirmed the design and functionality.

**Phase 2:**
- **Backend:** New FastAPI models, services, and routes were created for RFQ (Request-for-Quote), Quote, Negotiation, and Purchase Order management. This included , , , and . Backend tests showed a 91.7% success rate, confirming all critical B2B workflows.
- **Frontend:** A complete B2B frontend package was delivered, including:
    - TypeScript interfaces and an API client (, , ).
    - Shared UI components (, , ).
    - Core screens: RFQ Dashboard (), RFQ Creation (), Quote Management (), Negotiation Interface (), and PO Tracker ().
    - A navigation hook was provided to link to the B2B section from the main app.

The current state is that both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are fully implemented and integrated. The AI engineer has delivered a comprehensive B2B frontend package, ready for the user's team to perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
