AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 B2C/B2B marketplace aiming for Series A investment. The core problem was to evolve it into a polished, global-ready shopper-only v1 with AI-centric, luxury UX. Initial functionalities included persistent carts, voice shopping, AI recommendations, Stripe payments, and order management. A key user request was a new, comprehensive 7-step onboarding flow: promotional video landing page with Sign In/Sign Up, social/Apple/Google authentication, all-device permissions, AI welcome/intro, user preferences, package selection, and finally, the main app screen. This onboarding needed to be full-screen, cinematic, and luxurious, embodying the Shop. Socialise. Live Modern. vision, positioning AisleMarts as the first true Lifestyle Commerce Platform.

Building on this, Phase 1 features included enhanced lifestyle categories, basic social sharing (AisleMarts Socialise mini TikTok feed with Shop the Look), user profile setup with taste preferences, and expanded AI recommendations (Mood-to-Cart™). Phase 2 aimed for a 14-Day Dual-Track Blitz encompassing Creator Tools, Live Commerce, a Vendor Onboarding Portal, a Referral Engine, Paywall Experiments, a Private Beta Cohort, a North-Star Dashboard for KPIs, Content Flywheel challenges, and enhanced Security & Trust. The latest requests include Stories and Direct Messaging to finalize the social commerce ecosystem.
