The trajectory details the continued development of the AisleMarts application by an AI engineer. Initially, the engineer fixed a critical import error in  and a typo in , ensuring core functionality. Subsequently, a major new feature, the comprehensive AisleMarts Rewards System (inspired by TikTok LIVE), was designed and implemented. This involved creating new backend API routes and services (, ), a TypeScript frontend client (), and multiple new frontend screens (, , , , , , ). The BlueWave Safe branding was removed, and the rewards functionality was integrated into the main  dashboard. The final stage involved adding advanced real-time WebSocket integration, AI personalization, and performance optimization services (, , , ), with comprehensive backend and frontend testing successfully conducted throughout these phases. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer preparing for a final comprehensive system test of the entire expanded application.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts, originally a Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform, evolved into BlueWave AisleMarts, a Family-Safe AI-Powered Commerce Platform. Initial requirements included Investor Demo readiness, Global Localization, Universal Commerce AI Hub, Go-Live readiness, and Enhanced Security (E2EE/KMS). It features a 7-tab navigation, Business Console, and the BlueWave Family, Safety & Wellbeing System (screen time, parental controls). A major pivot introduced TikTok-inspired social commerce: personalized video feeds (For You), grid discovery (Explore), Creator Studio, Live Shopping, and social engagement features. The latest vision is a unified AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem with Aisle AI for automated vendor outreach and a smart shopper companion. Most recently, a comprehensive AisleMarts Rewards System, inspired by TikTok LIVE Rewards, has been implemented, encompassing shopper/vendor missions, gamification (AisleCoins, BlueWave Points, Vendor Stars, Cashback), dashboards, notifications, and supporting APIs for a frictionless, lifestyle-driven shopping journey.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing advanced real-time features, AI personalization, and performance optimizations. This involved creating and integrating several new backend services and routers: , , , and . A corresponding frontend real-time service, , was also created. The backend was successfully restarted after these additions. The last action indicates that the AI engineer is about to run a final comprehensive system test to validate all the newly implemented and integrated features, ensuring the entire expanded AisleMarts application is fully functional and stable. This follows extensive development and testing of the Aisle AI service and the comprehensive Rewards System, which are confirmed to be operational.
