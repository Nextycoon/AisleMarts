The trajectory outlines the AI engineer's work on the AisleMarts application. Initially, the AI engineer's self-summary claimed a comprehensive Direct Messaging (DM) system was implemented (Chat Message 7). However, a subsequent verification by the AI engineer revealed that no such implementation existed in the codebase, indicating a critical hallucination (Chat Messages 9-22). The engineer then correctly pivoted to implementing the Direct Messaging system (Phase 1) from scratch, covering both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, WebSockets, AES-256-GCM encryption) and frontend (Expo Router screens, UI components). Backend testing passed, and frontend testing (75% functional) partially passed, with real-time WebSocket features needing live environment validation. The work then extended to Phase 2, implementing Calls, Channels, LiveSale, and Leads CRM, including backend models, services, routes, and frontend integration. The final stage involved generating and delivering comprehensive operational and investor-readiness documents, including an Emergent Master Launch Pack and a detailed Emergent Paste Guide for automated deployment, and pre-filled starter content for these documents. The immediate next task is to provide a 90-second Investor Patrol Route demo script.

AisleMarts is a B2C/B2B Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform targeting Series A, aiming for an AI-centric, luxury UX. Core features included persistent carts, AI recommendations, and a 7-step cinematic onboarding (authentication, permissions, AI welcome, preferences, package selection), embodying a Shop. Socialise. Live Modern. vision.
Phase 1 added enhanced lifestyle categories, a TikTok-style social feed (Shop the Look), user profiles, and AI Mood-to-Cart™. Phase 2 introduced Creator Tools, Live Commerce, Vendor Onboarding, Private Beta Cohort, North-Star Dashboard, and Viral Growth Challenges. The current focus is on a Luxury Communication Suite with:
*   **Direct Messaging**: 1:1/group chats, luxury UI, product sharing, read receipts, typing indicators, real-time WebSockets, AES-256-GCM encryption, push notifications.
*   **Calling System**: Voice/video calls (WebRTC) with luxury UI and call-to-cart.
*   **Channels & Broadcast**: Creator/vendor channels, community groups.
*   **Classifieds & Marketplace**: Peer-to-peer luxury classifieds with escrow.
*   **LiveSale**: Scheduled live streams with limited-quantity product drops, floating purchase, gamified rewards.
*   **Leads**: Business-focused DM inbox for customer conversations, product sharing, and sales funnel integration.
The overarching goal is to transform AisleMarts into a Super-App for investor readiness, including comprehensive operational and deployment artifacts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the delivery of pre-filled starter content for several crucial operational and investor-readiness documents. These documents, requested by the user, transform the technical implementation into a comprehensive business operations and deployment package. The delivered files include:
*   : A 24-hour launch protocol.
*   : A 10-minute presentation flow for investors.
*   : An automated smoke test suite for critical scenarios.
*   : An incident response playbook with SLO alerts.
*   : A day-by-day guide for initial launch week operations.
*   : Protocols for application and environment rollbacks.
*   : A pre-configured JSON for Grafana dashboards with key business and technical KPIs.

These documents complement the recently implemented backend and frontend for the Luxury Communication Suite (Direct Messaging, Calls, Channels, LiveSale, Leads CRM), and the previously established cinematic onboarding, lifestyle categories, social feed, AI Mood-to-Cart™, stories, and other core features. The immediate work was focused on providing these ready-to-use artifacts, bridging the gap from technical development to full business operational readiness and investor presentation mastery. The system is now positioned as a one-click luxury social commerce super-app generator via the Emergent Master Pack and Emergent Paste Guide, which were also recently delivered. The next explicit request is for a condensed 90-second demo script.
