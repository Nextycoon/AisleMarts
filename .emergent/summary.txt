The trajectory details the AI engineer's comprehensive work on the AisleMarts application, transitioning it from core functionalities to a sophisticated, culturally-integrated, and performance-optimized platform for its Kenya pilot. Initially, the engineer focused on building an Operational Intelligence Master Bundle for monitoring and alerts. Subsequently, the Sprint K-1 focused on Kenya Pilot readiness, mobile optimization, and critical UX refinements, including multi-language AI, M-Pesa integration, and device-specific performance. The AI engineer meticulously fixed backend routing/currency issues and frontend bugs, introduced new UI components and utility files, and documented progress through detailed reports. The final phase involved creating a complete Go-Live Gate validation framework, including test templates and execution checklists, culminating in a ready-to-deploy system, poised for the Kenya pilot launch and global expansion.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts aims to be an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace, utilizing AI-driven logistics and human-centric commerce to overcome global trade fragmentation. The application was to feature an AI Agent (Aisle Character), automatic localization (currency, language, location), and global marketplace integration, including seller onboarding, 1% commission, and M-Pesa. The Blue Era Dashboard with AI avatar, product reels, and empathy automation was a core component. The MVP roadmap covered authentication, AI, product browsing, and localization (Phase 1), followed by full backend integration, trust scoring, and AI personalization (Phase 2). The most recent work explicitly focused on enhancing multi-vendor capabilities, including a comprehensive seller dashboard and order management, specifically for the Kenya pilot launch, with an emphasis on mobile optimization, user experience, and cultural integration to achieve a world-class and beloved experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the Day 1 Operational Brief (). This document is the final piece of the Kenya Go-Live Gate Execution Checklist, outlining an hour-by-hour plan for the launch team to mobilize, set up devices, perform initial checks, and conduct team briefings. This brief officially initiates the 7-day countdown to the Kenya pilot launch. This concludes a development phase focused on achieving world-class UX transformation, including mobile performance optimization (lazy loading, bundle size reduction), network resilience (offline manager), UX refinements (AI input enhancements, humanized error messages), and trust-building micro-interactions (M-Pesa trust signals, loading states). The entire framework for validating and launching the Kenya pilot is now complete and delivered, ready for execution by the user's team.
