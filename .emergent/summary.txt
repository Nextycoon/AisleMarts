The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's comprehensive development of investor and operational documentation for the AisleMarts application. Initially tasked with a 90-second investor demo script, the scope rapidly escalated to include a cinematic storyboard, a full Series A pitch deck, Q&A arsenals, one-pagers, video pitch scripts, and a unified Blue Wave Investor Pack. This extensive documentation further evolved into detailed conversion guides, simulation drills, stage keynote scripts, and robust deployment strategies, including investor targeting maps and a real-time alert system with quiet hours protocol. The AI engineer consistently ensured Blue Wave branding with no red references. Following the completion of this exhaustive documentation suite, the user explicitly shifted focus back to core application development with the directive to do it all. The AI engineer acknowledged this pivot and is currently in the initial phase of assessing the application's current state to plan for these broad development tasks.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts is conceptualized as a B2C/B2B Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform for Series A investment, emphasizing an AI-centric, luxury user experience. Initial features included persistent carts, AI recommendations, and a 7-step cinematic onboarding (authentication, permissions, AI welcome, preferences, package selection). Subsequent phases introduced enhanced lifestyle categories, a TikTok-style social feed (Shop the Look), user profiles, AI Mood-to-Cartâ„¢, Creator Tools, Live Commerce, Vendor Onboarding, Private Beta Cohort, North-Star Dashboard, and Viral Growth Challenges. The current major focus was on a Luxury Communication Suite comprising: Direct Messaging (1:1/group chats, luxury UI, product sharing, read receipts, typing indicators, real-time WebSockets, AES-256-GCM encryption, push notifications), Calling System (voice/video calls with luxury UI and call-to-cart), Channels & Broadcast (creator/vendor channels, community groups), Classifieds & Marketplace, LiveSale (scheduled live streams with limited-quantity product drops), and Leads (business-focused DM inbox for sales funnel integration). The overarching goal is to transform AisleMarts into a Super-App for investor readiness, supported by comprehensive operational and deployment artifacts.

- **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript, , WebRTC.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB, , JWT, usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], AES-256-GCM (encryption), .
- **Architecture**: Monorepo, file-based routing, WebSocket for real-time, REST API.
- **Styling**: StyleSheet.create, matte black/champagne gold theme, glassmorphism, Blue Wave branding.
- **Testing**: Detox (E2E), Jest (Unit).

The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (Expo React Native).



**Summary of important files and changes (documented in trajectory):**
- ****: Numerous new markdown files were created covering investor pitches, operational guides, deployment plans, and training materials. These include , , , and many others, all branded as Blue Wave. These documents serve as the comprehensive investor and operational arsenal.
- **Email Templates**: Several personalized email templates for investor outreach were generated within the chat, aimed at specific VC firms and strategic partners.
- **HTML Landing Page**: A complete HTML code snippet for a single-page investor landing page was provided, incorporating Blue Wave branding.
- **Social Media Content**: LinkedIn and Twitter/X post templates were generated for Series A announcements and product demos.
- **Tracking and Alerts**: Frameworks for an  and a  (for real-time notifications) were defined as future files to be deployed by Emergent.

The  provided in the system prompt covers the application's backend and frontend structure and the initial changes for Direct Messaging, Calls, Channels, LiveSale, and Leads. The trajectory itself focused on *creating documentation* within the  directory, not directly modifying application code.

<pending_tasks>
- Full End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) implementation (client-generated keys, sealed session keys, disable server-side previews) if explicitly requested for enhanced compliance.
- Key Management System (KMS) and Push notification keys configuration.
- Implement new features, improve existing features, perform technical improvements, conduct testing and QA, and refine deployment/infrastructure for the AisleMarts application as part of the do it all directive for app development.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed an extensive phase of generating a comprehensive Blue Wave Investor Domination Arsenal. This included over 100 assets across 13 categories, ranging from a 90-second investor demo script () to a full 18-slide Series A pitch deck (), a Q&A defense arsenal (), executive one-pagers, video pitch scripts, conversion guides, simulation drills, and a master index (). Furthermore, the AI engineer provided personalized email templates, a complete HTML landing page, social media content, and designed frameworks for an  and a  (with Quiet Hours Override Protocol) to be deployed by an external Emergent system. All outputs consistently adhered to Blue Wave branding (matte black, champagne gold, blue wave colors) and were structured for immediate investor outreach.

The user then explicitly shifted focus from documentation to **app development**, giving the directive: do it all (Chat Message 116) across new features, existing feature improvements, technical improvements, testing, and deployment. The AI engineer has initiated this new phase by starting a **Current State Assessment** (Chat Message 117-119), reading the  file, and preparing to get a complete overview of recent work and current implementations within the codebase to inform the comprehensive development plan.
