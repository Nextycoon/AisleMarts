The AI engineer's work on AisleMarts focused on iteratively transforming the app into a pixel-perfect, TikTok-style social commerce platform. This involved meticulous UI/UX replication, starting with precise positioning of top/bottom navigation and right-side action icons in . Key achievements include implementing a full-screen, edge-to-edge video background with overlaid UI elements and dynamically moving the Trending Creators section from the For You to the Following page. A persistent JSX syntax error was resolved with the help of a  and a full file rewrite. Further enhancements included integrating a comprehensive X-style verification system (BlueWave, GoldWave, GreyWave badges) with supporting policy documents, and performing multiple aesthetic redesigns to achieve a world-class luxury and then elegant, compact look. The current, immediate task is to debug and fix the visibility of the  icon, which is being overridden by its internal styling.

AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem, built on a 0% commission pay-per-lead model. Key features include TikTok-inspired social commerce (video feeds, live shopping), Aisle AI for vendor outreach, a gamified Rewards System, Voice AI, AR/VR commerce, and global language support.

Explicit UI/UX requests included: a top navigation (), a right-side action rail ( with follow, , , , , , ), and a 7-tab bottom navigation (). The user also demanded a pixel-perfect, full-screen edge-to-edge video background with UI overlays, the relocation of Trending AisleMarts Creators to the Following page, and an X (Twitter)-style verification system (BlueWave, GoldWave, GreyWave badges) with subscription tiers and formal policies. The app needed stylish, elegant, and compact redesigns for all icons and UI elements, and precise positioning of the  icon.

-   ****: The core feed screen. This file has undergone the most significant changes. It now renders a full-screen, edge-to-edge video background with all UI elements (top navigation, right-side actions, creator info, bottom navigation) overlaid. It implements scroll-based animations for top navigation visibility. The right-side action icons (7 total) are positioned at  with 16px margins, and display elegant, compact, and sharp designs with glassmorphism and glow effects. The creator info is positioned just above the bottom navigation. It integrates X-style verified badges and supports a multi-tier AisleMarts verification system. A  component is intended to be rendered here, currently facing visibility issues due to style conflicts.
-   ****: Displays content from followed creators. This file was modified to house the Trending AisleMarts Creators section, which was moved from , and now features luxury styling with golden accents and live indicators.
-   ****: Custom component for the top navigation bar (). It was styled for luxury aesthetics with golden accents and improved typography, and integrated with  for animated hiding/showing.
-   ****: Component for the AI assistant icon. It defines its own internal positioning styles () which are currently clashing with external positioning attempts, making it invisible on the screen.
-   ****: A new documentation file detailing AisleMarts subscription plans, badge requirements, payment terms, and appeals processes for the verification system.
-   ****: A new documentation file outlining the application processes, verification standards, compliance requirements, and fraud prevention measures for the AisleMarts verification system.

- Ensure the  icon is clearly visible and correctly positioned under all 7 right-side action icons. The current issue is that the component's internal positioning style is overriding external layout attempts.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving a critical visibility issue with the  icon in the  screen. The user explicitly requested that the AisleAI icon be moved down under the 7 icons down under the sound icon. Initial attempts to set its  position in  (first to , then ) failed to make the icon visible. The AI engineer identified that the  component itself (located at ) contains an internal  style with absolute positioning () which is overriding the desired external placement. The next step is to programmatically override this internal style.

The application currently boasts:
-   A **full-screen, edge-to-edge video background** in , with all UI elements perfectly overlaid.
-   **Top navigation** and **right-side action icons** that are elegantly designed with glassmorphism, glow effects, and precise spacing, positioned for optimal visibility and interaction. The 7 right-side icons are at  with 16px margins.
-   The **creator info section** (username, caption, hashtags, music) is positioned just above the bottom navigation.
-   An **AisleMarts Verification & Subscription System** is implemented, featuring BlueWave (shopper), GoldWave (brand), and GreyWave (institution) badges. The GoldWave badge is visible next to . Official  and  documents are created.
-   The **Trending AisleMarts Creators** section has been successfully moved to the  page, adorned with luxury styling.
-   All backend services are confirmed to be fully functional, passing all 22 tests.
