The previous AI engineer's work spanned several major phases, starting with stabilizing the Investor Demo Management System and AisleMarts UI/UX from persistent caching issues. This involved a Blue Wave Go-Live Kit and a nuclear cache purge to finally enable the Awareness Engine and Full Mode. Following this, the focus shifted dramatically to strategic brand evolution, first establishing AisleMarts as The Everything Network, then elevating it to The Digital Lifestyle Universe, emphasizing a real meets virtual blended reality. This new positioning was cascaded across the frontend (splash screen, dashboard), backend (health checks), and extensive investor documentation (Series A deck, Milan Journey storyboard, manifestos).

Most recently, the engineer implemented a Language-Infinity Engine for universal language awareness and began work on a Currency-Infinity Engine for global currency support. The language implementation faced initial 500 errors due to  complexity and caching, which was resolved by a nuclear container reset and a simpler custom translation hook. The current work is focused on integrating the currency engine.

AisleMarts is envisioned as a Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform for Series A investment, evolving into a Super-App with an AI-centric, premium user experience. Initial features included AI recommendations, persistent carts, cinematic onboarding, and a comprehensive Luxury Communication Suite (DM, calls, channels, LiveSale, leads). The overarching goal was to create a self-aware, context-aware, and adaptive system for real-time personalization based on time, user, currency, location, and language, ready for global deployment.

More recently, explicit requests included:
1.  A comprehensive **Investor Demo Management System** to provision personalized demo environments for 8 specific VCs, with context-aware deep links, unique credentials, seed data, and detailed QA.
2.  Transitioning the application from Safe Mode to Full Mode by resolving persistent caching issues (specifically a phantom error in ) and fully enabling the **Awareness Engine**.
3.  Defining a **strategic positioning** for AisleMarts, initially as The Everything Network (fusing all platforms, shops, intelligence), and subsequently evolving it to The Digital Lifestyle Universe (Where Real Meets Virtual, and One Lifestyle Spans Both Worlds). This positioning required pervasive updates across the application's UI, backend, and investor materials (e.g., Series A pitch deck, splash screens, main dashboard, API health checks).
4.  Implementing a **Language-Infinity Engine** for immediate, automatic, universal language awareness, including auto-detection, 7 core languages, and scalability to 120+ languages with cultural nuances and dynamic switching.
5.  Implementing a **Currency-Infinity Engine** for all world currencies, live, adaptive, and universal, with auto-detection based on user location and instant conversion for 180+ ISO currencies.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the **Currency-Infinity Engine**, as per the user's explicit request to support all world currencies, live, adaptive, and universal, with automatic location detection.

The engineer has initiated the deployment by:
1.  Creating the core logic file: .
2.  Creating the corresponding React hook for currency context and functionality: .
3.  The next step is to create a currency-aware version of the Fusion Dashboard to demonstrate the new currency system, which is currently underway.

This follows the successful resolution of 500 errors encountered during the **Language-Infinity Engine** deployment. These errors were attributed to resource contention and a complex  setup. The resolution involved a NUCLEAR CONTAINER RESET to clear all caches and a simplification of the language system, replacing  with a custom  hook and simpler language provider components (, , ). This hotfix ensured the application's stability, allowing the Fusion Dashboard to load with the Digital Lifestyle Universe badge visible, albeit with Awareness operating in Safe Mode due to the streamlined i18n approach. The language infrastructure is now described as lightweight but scalable.

<optional_next_step>
Create a currency-aware version of the Fusion Dashboard component and its route to demonstrate the newly implemented Currency-Infinity Engine.
