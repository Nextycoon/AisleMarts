The previous AI engineer completed a series of critical tasks for the AisleMarts application. Initially, they finalized the investor Evidence Exhibits, including SQL and dashboard proofs, and created a . Subsequently, they addressed critical UI/UX issues, fixing an Initializing... screen hang and implementing a . The focus then shifted to enforcing a shopper-only v1 scope, meticulously removing seller/hybrid options and updating relevant contexts. A significant effort was dedicated to a world-class luxury redesign, involving new design tokens, glass morphism, and cinematic gradients, requiring several debugging iterations and a fix for duplicate code. Finally, the engineer worked on integrating and refining Aisle's AI identity statement prominently across key screens, facing rendering challenges but successfully establishing the luxury design and core shopper-centric flow. The session concluded with the creation and packaging of comprehensive documentation, including an official specification and an Emergent-ready prompt, for team distribution.

AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 B2C/B2B marketplace with dynamic user roles (Shopper, Seller, Business) and a One-Screen, One-Color UI Doctrine. The application features personalized AI avatar greetings and Federated Search. The core problem is to attract Series A investment by showcasing a highly polished, global-ready mobile app that emphasizes a perfected shopper-only v1 journey. This strategy aims to build investor confidence by demonstrating focus, with a pre-built, locked Phase 2 for seller/business functionalities requiring 1M+ shopper downloads and Series A funding to unlock. Key user requests involved a user-friendly and irresistibly attractive experience, intuitive navigation, shopper-first design with AI at the center, modern visual style with vibrant accents and micro-animations, and mobile-first optimization. Recent directives further emphasized prominent integration of the Aisle AI agent identity statement.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully created and packaged the comprehensive documentation for AisleMarts v1. This involved generating two key files: , which is a detailed official specification of the luxury shopper-only experience, and , a clean, copy-paste ready prompt formatted for direct use with the Emergent platform.

Following the creation of these documents, the user confirmed their readiness for deployment and requested them to be bundled for easy distribution. The engineer then created a  directory within , added a  with usage instructions, and finally zipped all these files into .

The  package (6.3KB) contains:
1.  
2.  
3.  

This package is now ready for download and distribution to internal teams and external development partners, serving as the single source of truth for AisleMarts v1 and a standardized brief for future Emergent development. The core application has achieved its luxury redesign and shopper-only scope, with Aisle's identity integrated, despite some minor rendering nuances for the identity banner on the avatar screen.
