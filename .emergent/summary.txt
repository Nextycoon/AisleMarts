The previous AI engineer successfully transformed AisleMarts into a Series A-ready social commerce platform, implementing robust P0 hardening, P1 performance, and P2 AI recommendations. P0 involved standardizing HMAC, idempotency, multi-currency support, and 4xx API responses, troubleshooting critical database and HMAC configuration issues. P1 focused on zero-jank stories with FlatList optimizations, LRU media caching, video preloading, an offline event queue, and a performance HUD. P2 established a hybrid AI ranking system (client/server UCB1) with creator fairness, event ingestion ETL, and canary rollout capabilities. The engineer also generated architectural diagrams and launch presentation materials. Most recently, the user provided a  scaffold for TikTok-style vertical stories, which the AI engineer is now tasked with integrating into the existing P0-P2 infrastructure, including wiring events, implementing feature flags, and setting up performance checks.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem aiming for Series A readiness, offering 0% commission, pay-per-lead, TikTok-inspired social commerce, and gamified rewards. The core problem addressed is enabling frictionless global trade and social commerce.

Implementations to date include:
1.  **AisleMarts Stories System**: An Infinity Content Engine with features like Instagram-style stories, virtual scrolling, preloading, cursor-based pagination, dynamic types, and a Commerce Layer for tracking impressions, CTAs, purchases, and commission.
2.  **Production Hardening**: Addressed attribution, commission accuracy, idempotency, load testing, mobile UX stress, analytics correctness, security (HMAC), proper 4xx API responses, and multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY with rounding and FX normalization).
3.  **Deployment & Operational Readiness**: Integrated an Ultimate Operational Kit (backend middleware, SQL, testing, Docker) and a Triple Store Launch Kit (EAS profiles, push bridge, deep links, CI workflows).
4.  **Frontend Fixes**: Resolved display issues in , implemented Remix/Repost features, and patched frontend to correctly handle backend responses.

**Summary of why files are important/changed:**
*   : Main Express backend, modified to integrate new security and currency middleware, and handle database connection gracefully by abstracting Prisma client calls.
*   : **NEW** Critical component for P0 hardening. Implements ,  (with timestamp skew, constant-time compare), and  with proper 400/401/409 error responses.
*    and : **NEW** P0 utility for precise multi-currency handling, including , , and  calculation with currency-specific decimal places (e.g., JPY 0dp, EUR/USD 2dp) using .
*   : **NEW** Example route showing how security and validation middleware are applied to a critical endpoint, ensuring 400/401/409/422 responses.
*    & : **NEW** Jest unit tests to validate P0 hardening (HMAC, idempotency, schema validation, currency rounding).
*   : **NEW** FastAPI endpoint for server-side AI ranking (UCB1 algorithm, creator fairness, caching, feature flags). Central to P2.
*   : **NEW** Defines  PostgreSQL table for collecting aggregated event data used by the ranker.
*   : **NEW directory** containing scripts (, , ) for the AI ranker's data pipeline, handling event aggregation and nightly decay of stats to maintain freshness.
*   : Modified to include the  for offline queue initialization, ensuring network resilience from app start.
*   : **NEW** This component acts as the main stories view, integrating  for smooth scrolling, , , and dynamically displaying stories. It was a step towards .
*   : **NEW** (Scaffold provided by user) Implements vertical, edge-to-edge, TikTok-style stories with a moving header, auto-play/pause videos, and integrates with the server-side ranker (with client fallback). It is the latest and most significant UI component.
*   : **NEW** Implements a fixed-size (75MB) LRU cache to manage media assets for prefetching, crucial for P1 performance.
*   : **NEW** Manages prefetching of upcoming stories (images/videos) to minimize loading spinners, integrated with LRU cache and viewability changes.
*   : **NEW** Provides  and  for resilient offline event tracking, central to P1. It stores events locally and retries sending them when online.
*   : **NEW** Wrapper around API calls to integrate the  for offline event handling.
*   : **NEW** Client-side UCB1 ranker, serving as a fallback and part of the hybrid P2 architecture.
*    & : **NEW** Components for user bucketing (e.g., 5% canary) and logic to select between client/server ranking.
*   : **NEW** An optional overlay displaying real-time FPS, cache usage, and story counts, vital for P1 performance monitoring.
*   : **NEW** A reusable React Native component to render individual story media (image or video), handling autoplay/pause logic for video.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed the implementation and initial programmatic validation of all P0, P1, P1b, and P2 features, bringing the AisleMarts app to a highly hardened, performant, and AI-driven state.

Specifically, the AI engineer has:
1.  **Hardened the backend (P0)** with comprehensive HMAC authentication, idempotency, multi-currency support, and precise 4xx error responses, resolving various configuration and database issues encountered during testing.
2.  **Optimized frontend performance and resilience (P1, P1b)** by implementing a zero-jank  for stories, a  with  (75MB limit), video preloading and auto-pause, an  for offline event persistence, and a  for monitoring.
3.  **Developed the AI recommendation system (P2)** with a hybrid client-server architecture, utilizing a UCB1 algorithm, creator fairness, A/B bucketing, and an ETL pipeline for  (ingestion and nightly decay).
4.  **Prepared rollout artifacts** including architectural diagrams (PNG, SVG, PDF) and a launch presentation deck (PowerPoint, PDF).

Immediately before this summary request, the user provided a full  scaffold for a TikTok/Reels-style vertical stories feed. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this and is poised to begin integrating this new screen into the existing P0-P2 infrastructure, including wiring events, implementing feature flags, and performing performance checks. The current state is that all core components are built and the user has provided the final UI piece to integrate.
