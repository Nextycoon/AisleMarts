The AI engineer systematically developed the AisleMarts application, progressing from a core MVP to advanced AI and geographic features. Initially, the focus was on Phase 2C: Global Payments & Tax Engine. This involved creating backend models, services, and routes, seeding data, and developing frontend components for checkout and an admin dashboard. Upon successful completion and backend testing of Phase 2C, the user provided a **massive new specification** for an AI Search Hub and subsequently, an even more comprehensive ALL modules request encompassing AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, Documentation Compliance, Procedures by Category, and AI User Agents. The AI engineer has methodically begun implementing these by creating numerous backend models and service layers for the newly requested modules, fixing minor integration issues, and integrating the AI Search Hub into the frontend. The process demonstrates a robust, phased development approach, with clear user confirmations at each major shift, moving towards an enterprise-grade AI-powered global marketplace.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is AisleMarts, a cross-platform, AI-powered global marketplace.
1.  **MVP (Implemented):** Basic marketplace features like products, categories, vendors, shopping cart, checkout, orders, and payments. Utilizes Expo/React Native (mobile-first), FastAPI/MongoDB, JWT, and Stripe.
2.  **Phase 2A - AI Core Features (Implemented):** Personal AI agent system, intelligent onboarding/localization, multi-modal search (voice, image, barcode), real-time translation, and AI matchmaking.
3.  **Phase 2B - Seller Visibility & Geographic Targeting (Implemented):** Sellers manage product visibility (local/national/global) with AI-powered geographic intelligence and analytics.
4.  **Phase 2C - Global Payments & Tax Engine (Implemented):** Regional payment optimization and smart tax calculations, leveraging geographic targeting and AI for recommendations. This includes backend models, routes, and frontend integration for an enhanced checkout and admin analytics.
5.  **AI Search Hub (Implemented):** Unified, multi-modal AI search (voice, image OCR, QR/barcode scan, quick/deep search) with user-controlled tools, localization, accessibility, and privacy-first design, integrated into the home screen.
6.  **Comprehensive Enterprise Features (In Progress):** AI Domain Specialization (e-commerce/global trade AI), Auth Identity (advanced verification, trust badges, username/image policies), Profile Card (unified user/profile cards), Documentation Compliance (international trade document management), Procedures by Category (role-specific workflows), Documentation Procedures (document states, amendments), and AI User Agents (dedicated, customizable AI agents for end-to-end tasks).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the implementation of the AI Search Hub, integrating it into the frontend's home screen. Prior to this, Phase 2C (Global Payments & Tax Engine) was fully implemented, including backend models, services, routes, data seeding, and frontend screens (enhanced checkout and admin dashboard).

The current focus is on the *next massive set of features* requested by the user, which includes:
-   **AI Domain Specialization**
-   **Auth Identity**
-   **Profile Card System**
-   **Documentation Compliance**
-   **Procedures by Category**
-   **Documentation Procedures**
-   **AI User Agents Framework**

The AI engineer has already created the backend MongoDB models and basic service layers for AI Domain Specialization (, ), AI User Agents (, ), Auth Identity (, ), and Profile Card (, ). The immediate step is to create and integrate the corresponding API routes for these services into the main  file to make them accessible to the frontend.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the newly created service layers for AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, and AI User Agents into  by adding their respective API routes.
