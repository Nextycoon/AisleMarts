The previous AI engineer successfully launched AisleMarts as a Series-A ready application, building core systems, the Language and Currency-Infinity Engines, and the Universal Commerce AI Hub with its comprehensive frontend. They also implemented production-grade features like A/B testing and an Executive Dashboard. The recent trajectory focused on completing an extensive Series A investor package, including a detailed investor deck outline, one-pager, cold email templates, and a risk register. Following this, the user requested an expansion, leading to the development of several new Total Domination features across technical, business, and operational domains. This involved creating new backend routers and services, integrating them into , and developing corresponding frontend screens. While significant documentation and initial code structure for these new features were created, the backend router integration faced errors, indicating ongoing challenges in making these new modules fully functional.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), TypeScript, , , Context API.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB,  for environment variables, A/B testing framework, production monitoring.
-   **Architecture**: Monorepo structure, modular engine design (Language, Currency, AI), global state providers.
-   **LLM Integration**: Multi-LLM router (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Emergent) for cost optimization.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure, segregating  (FastAPI) and  (Expo React Native).



**Summary of important files and changes:**
-   ****: **MODIFIED**. Includes new API routers for , , , and , integrating these new modules into the FastAPI application.
-   ** and  (NEW files)**: New router and service files (e.g., , ) were created to house the backend logic for the expanded Total Domination features.
-   ****: **NEW FILE**. This screen serves as a comprehensive demo for the Currency-Infinity v2.0, displaying real-time currency conversion, auto-detection, dual display, crypto rates, rounding, retail margins, and observability. It utilizes  and  for geo-based currency detection.
-   ****: **NEW FILE**. A new frontend screen created to host and interact with the enhanced technical features.
-   ** (NEW files)**: Numerous new  files were generated to complete the Series A investor package (e.g., , , ) and for documenting the Total Domination initiative (e.g., , ).

<pending_tasks>
-   Full End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) implementation (client-generated keys, sealed session keys, disable server-side previews).
-   Key Management System (KMS) and Push notification keys configuration.
-   Debugging and ensuring the proper loading and functionality of all newly created backend routers and their associated services, as import errors and router loading issues were observed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in the Total Domination phase, implementing numerous new features across technical, business, and operational domains. This involved creating new backend router and service files (e.g., for , , , ) and integrating these new routers into the main  file. Corresponding frontend screens like  were also being created. Additionally, a detailed  was provided to demonstrate the Currency-Infinity v2.0. The engineer successfully created extensive documentation for the Series A investor package and the expanded features. However, during the process of integrating the new backend routers, the system encountered issues with router loading, indicated by messages such as ALL-IN MICRO-SPRINT indexes module not found and persistent import errors, suggesting that some of the newly added backend functionalities might not be fully operational or correctly wired up yet. The final action was creating the  document, followed by a backend restart, but the underlying router issues were not explicitly resolved.
