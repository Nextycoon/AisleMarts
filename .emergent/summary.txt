The AI engineer's trajectory shows a clear progression from initial app development and strategic documentation to implementing core architectural features and a comprehensive global launch strategy. Key phases included: establishing the Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 Update with dynamic UI and AI agent, developing a Quality-to-Hires Converter and investor-ready documents, and integrating a multi-user interface with role-based UIs.

Recent efforts focused on two non-negotiables: a Federated Search across multiple e-commerce platforms and a One-Screen, One-Color UI Doctrine. This led to the deployment of a 3-tier user architecture (Shopper, Vendor, Business) and integration of Turkish e-commerce platforms. The final strategic pivot was a two-phase Global Viral Launch Strategy with an investor-ready package, integrating online and onsite search logic. The current task involves preparing investor-ready launch deck content, specifically the text and structure, for approval.

AisleMarts is an AI-powered B2C/B2B marketplace aiming for Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 featuring dynamic user roles (Shopper, Seller, Hybrid/Business), distinct UI themes with Bold Glass-Morphism, personalized AI avatar greetings (Aisle), and role-based quick actions. An investor-ready ecosystem was required, including a Quality-to-Hires Converter, Recruitment Radar Dashboard, Global Expansion Playbook, and AI Supply Chain Intelligence. Recent explicit demands include a Federated Search surfacing products from all e-commerce platforms via a unified, AI-normalized feed, and a One-Screen, One-Color UI Doctrine (e.g., Shopper-Blue, Vendor-Indigo, Business-Teal). The launch strategy transitioned to a two-phase Global Viral Launch First (Shopper app globally) followed by Marketplace Activation (country-by-country vendor/business onboarding) with dual-mode AI search (Online + Onsite).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with integrating the Global Viral Launch Strategy (Phase 1: Shopper App, Phase 2: Marketplace Activation) into an investor-ready package, specifically incorporating the Online and Onsite dual-mode AI search logic.

The AI engineer has generated comprehensive App Store listings for Apple, Google Play, Huawei, and Web/PWA, emphasizing the Aisle AI Shopping Companion and federated search capabilities, while strategically omitting marketplace features for Phase 1. A Viral Media Kit with TikTok/Reels/YouTube scripts and a detailed Vendor Onboarding Kit (for Phase 2, hidden) have also been created.

Currently, the AI engineer is in the process of drafting the detailed content and structure for the Investor Deck, which will encompass the Vision & Core Doctrine, User Interfaces & Applications, Dual-Mode AI Search flow, Launch Phases, Competitive Advantage, Global Expansion Roadmap, Revenue Model, and Growth Projections. This is a foundational step before generating the actual PDF, Word, or HTML investor package files. The Online vs Onsite search logic is a critical new integration being woven into this deck's narrative.
