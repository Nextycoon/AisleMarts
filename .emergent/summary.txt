This trajectory details the AI engineer's comprehensive development of the AisleMarts application from 0 to 1, under direct user command. Initially, the AI engineer established a multi-track plan (Investor Demo, Business Ops, AI Supercharge, Ops & Resilience) after the user prioritized a shopper-only v1 app. The user repeatedly mandated ALL NOW, NONSTOP, UNSTOPPABLE parallel execution. The AI engineer diligently implemented and verified each track, creating numerous new files (APIs, UI components, ops scripts, documentation). Key achievements include a Mood-to-Cart AI, multi-language voice, full business operations UIs/APIs, and enterprise-grade operational resilience. All four core tracks were declared 100% complete, achieving Series A Total Domination. The conversation then shifted to preparing investor assets and global rollout plans, again with parallel execution. The final interaction involves the user requesting a full suite of automation artifacts (CI/CD, Kubernetes, backups, monitoring) to ensure 24/7/365 self-sustaining operation, to which the AI engineer agreed to generate everything.

AisleMarts is an AI-powered Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 B2C/B2B marketplace. The primary goal is attracting Series A investment with a polished, global-ready shopper-only v1 mobile app, featuring a user-friendly, AI-centric, luxury experience with intuitive navigation and prominent Aisle AI agent identity. The vision extends to Phase 3: AI-Controlled, Shopper + Media Ecosystem, integrating multi-screen viewing, an AI command layer for voice/chat control, and user/vendor-generated media. The app needed to be Series A Ready with persistent carts, voice shopping, AI recommendations, Stripe payments, and order management. Subsequent directives expanded requirements to include Admin Orders UI, Vendor Management, Analytics API, multi-language voice intents, contextual recommendations, Mood-to-Cart commands, Grafana alerts, Kubernetes deployment, and automated DB backups, all under a mandate for parallel development and self-sustaining 24/7/365 operations.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure, primarily containing  (FastAPI) and  (Expo React Native) components, along with  and  for infrastructure.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Summary of important files and changes:**
-   : The main FastAPI entry point; frequently modified to integrate new modular routers from .
-   : This directory houses all API endpoints. Significant additions include  (Track B, managing vendor CRUD and products),  (Track B, for business metrics),  (Track C, multi-language voice processing), and  (Track C, session-based AI).
-   : A new screen (Track B) implementing a comprehensive Admin Orders UI.
-   : A new screen (Track C) for the AI Co-Pilot conversational interface.
-   : A new component (Track C) for advanced AI personalization features.
-   , , : New operational files (Track D) for Grafana alerts, Kubernetes deployment, and automated MongoDB backups.
-   Various  files (e.g., , ): These were created as part of investor readiness and strategic planning deliverables.

<pending_tasks>
All four initial development tracks (Investor-Ready Demos, Business Ops Expansion, AI Supercharge, Ops & Resilience) are declared 100% complete. The immediate pending task is to generate the full suite of operational automation files (CI/CD, Kubernetes, alerts, runbook, Terraform, Helm, Grafana JSON) for 24/7/365 self-sustaining operation, as per the user's explicit command OPTION C - GENERATE EVERYTHING NOW.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to the user's latest message, the AI engineer completed several micro-missions in parallel:
- **Track 1 (Investor Pack) Finalization**: The APK/IPA demo bundle was completed, evidenced by the creation of . This included production build configurations and a 3-minute demo script.
- **Track 4 (Strategic Partnerships) Completion**: Strategic partnership MOUs were drafted and completed, recorded in . These covered fintech, logistics, platform, and media alliances.
- **Track 3 (AI Supercharge) Extension**: Advanced AI Co-Pilot V2 features, specifically for personalization, were completed with the creation of . This enabled cross-device sync, personality profiling, and purchase pattern analysis.

At this point, all four core development tracks (Investor Demo, Business Ops, AI Supercharge, Ops & Resilience) were declared 100% complete and operational, with breakthroughs like Mood-to-Cart and multi-language AI validated. The AI engineer then presented four next-phase operations (Investor Pack Live Deployment, Global Rollout Activation, AI R&D Escalation, and Partnership Formalization) and asked for confirmation to execute all in parallel. The user explicitly commanded to EXECUTE ALL FOUR NEXT-PHASE MOVES IN PARALLEL NOW. Following this, the AI engineer shifted focus to implementing continuous operational excellence, providing a comprehensive operations playbook for 24/7/365 self-sustaining infrastructure and awaiting the user's choice to generate specific files. The user's most recent message confirmed OPTION C - GENERATE EVERYTHING NOW.
