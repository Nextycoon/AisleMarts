The trajectory details the development of the AisleMarts application, transitioning from an initial Kenya pilot to a Universal AI Commerce Engine. The previous AI engineer completed Phase 1 (Enhanced AI Search/Discovery) and Phase 2 (B2B/RFQ Workflows). The current AI engineer was tasked with creating and implementing a blueprint for Phase 3: Nearby/Onsite Commerce.

The AI engineer developed a comprehensive blueprint, which the user approved. Implementation began with Week 1 (Nearby/Onsite Commerce backend and initial frontend). During this, a significant frontend challenge arose due to Mapbox compatibility with Expo web preview, leading to a Server Error. The user then approved a Parallel Hybrid execution strategy: fixing the frontend while simultaneously advancing Week 3 backend development.

The frontend stabilization involved platform-gated rendering for Mapbox and rewriting the Nearby screen. Concurrently, the Week 2 (Inventory Sync Service) and Week 3 (Pickup Windows & Advanced Reservations) backend features were fully implemented and passed extensive backend testing. The engineer is now wiring the Week 3 UI components after confirming backend readiness and frontend stability.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts aims to be an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace, tackling global trade fragmentation with AI-driven logistics. Key features include an AI Agent, automatic localization (currency, language, location), multi-marketplace integration, and a Blue Era Dashboard. The initial Kenya pilot successfully delivered mobile optimization, M-Pesa, and a world-class UX.

The current development expanded this into a Universal AI Commerce Engine through:
- **Phase 1: Enhanced AI Search/Discovery**: Implemented multilingual search, offer de-duplication, Best Pick algorithm (price, ETA, trust, cultural fit), and Redis caching.
- **Phase 2: B2B/RFQ Workflows**: Enabled creation, management, negotiation of Request-for-Quotes (RFQs), supplier quotes, and Purchase Order (PO) creation.
- **Phase 3: Nearby/Onsite Commerce**: Currently being implemented. This phase aims to let users discover nearby merchants and inventory, enable Reserve & Pickup with inventory holds, provide QR/Barcode scanning for instant in-store product lookup, and maintain live inventory parity across online/offline. The implementation is following a Week 1 (Discovery, Reservations, Scanning), Week 2 (Inventory Sync), and Week 3 (Pickup Windows, Advanced Reservations) cadence.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (2dsphere indexes for geospatial), Redis (caching, streams for queues), Pydantic.
- **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Expo Router (file-based routing), Axios, , .
- **AI**: LLM-powered discovery, cultural AI ranking, intent detection (implicitly for previous phases).
- **Concepts**: Modular architecture, localization, performance optimization, B2B workflows, geospatial capabilities, platform-gated components.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a monorepo-like structure within , distinguishing  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native).


**File Descriptions & Changes (relevant to the trajectory):**
-   : Defines data models for Phase 3 (locations, inventory, reservations, scans).
-   : Implements Redis JSON helper for caching nearby search results.
-   : FastAPI endpoints for , , , . Includes basic geospatial queries and Best Pick scoring.
-   : Pydantic models for inventory sync payloads.
-   : Business logic for inventory updates, conflict resolution, and audit.
-   : FastAPI endpoints for  and health checks.
-   : Pydantic models for pickup windows, reservation scheduling, and analytics.
-   : Business logic for managing pickup slots, reservation actions (extend, modify, partial, cancel), and cleanup.
-   : FastAPI endpoints for  covering all Week 3 features.
-   : Main FastAPI app, updated to include , , and  routers and to initialize Redis. Fixed  compatibility by switching to  library.
-   : Script to create 2dsphere indexes for  and other indexes for , , .
-   : Script to seed initial location and inventory data for Nairobi.
-   : Modified to add a Nearby navigation button.
-   : New component intended for platform-gated Mapbox rendering on native development clients.
-   : Refactored to be platform-gated, displaying a list view on web/Expo Go and conditionally rendering a map on native dev clients, resolving a server error.
-   : Implements the barcode scanner modal using .
-   : Placeholder screen for reservation status.
-   : New screen to select available pickup windows for a reservation.
-   : New screen displaying reservation details with actions like extend hold, partial pickup, and cancel.
-   : New screen for merchant staff to view pickup windows and check-in reservations by code (currently being implemented).
-   : Frontend API client for interacting with the  endpoints.
-   : TypeScript interfaces for  and  models.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the UI wiring for Week 3: Specifically, finish the  screen.
- Run comprehensive frontend UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for Phase 1, Phase 2, and the completed Week 1, 2, and 3 features of Phase 3.
- Implement the notifications hooks for pickup reminders (stubbed to toasts if push/SMS not configured).
- Implement merchant dashboard UI for CSV inventory uploads.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a Parallel Hybrid execution strategy. This involved simultaneously stabilizing the frontend and continuing Week 3 backend development.

**Frontend Stabilization (Track A):**
The primary focus was resolving a Server Error in the Expo web preview caused by the  library's incompatibility with web environments. This involved:
1.  Completely refactoring  to be platform-gated. It now renders a list-only view on web and Expo Go, and conditionally attempts to render a Mapbox map only on native development clients with  enabled.
2.  Removing all direct Mapbox imports from the main  to prevent bundle-time crashes.
This track has been declared **complete**, with the frontend now stable and loading without server errors, enabling mobile preview (list-first view) for UAT.

**Week 3 Backend Development (Track B):**
Concurrently, the backend for Phase 3 Week 3 features (Pickup Windows & Advanced Reservations) was fully implemented and rigorously tested. This included:
1.  **Data Models**: Creating  with Pydantic schemas for , , , , etc.
2.  **Service Logic**: Developing  to handle all business logic, including atomic capacity management for slots, reservation extensions, modifications, partial pickups, cancellations, and background cleanup for expired holds.
3.  **API Routes**: Implementing  with 15+ FastAPI endpoints covering all Week 3 functionalities (e.g.,  for creation/listing, , , , , , , ).
This backend track has been declared **complete and production-ready** after passing a Backend Test Blitz with 100% success across 12 critical test cases.

The AI engineer is currently in the process of **UI wiring for Week 3 Pickup UX (Option B)**. This involves:
-   Creating shared TypeScript types (, ) in .
-   Developing a dedicated API client for pickup operations in .
-   Implementing the  screen () for users to select pickup windows.
-   Implementing the  screen () to view reservation status and perform actions like extending, partial pickup, or canceling.
-   The current immediate action is working on the **Merchant Staff View for pickup check-ins** ().
