The AI engineer's trajectory began with an extensive documentation phase, producing investor pitch decks, operational guides, and strategic plans for the AisleMarts application, all branded Blue Wave. Following this, the user pivoted the AI to do it all in app development. The AI engineer initiated a comprehensive Current State Assessment, then systematically implemented missing frontend components (LiveSale, Business Leads), enhanced existing features (WebRTC for calls), and debugged backend schema issues across various modules (Calls, Channels, LiveSale). Crucially, the AI developed and integrated an AisleMarts Awareness Engine, making the app dynamically adaptive to time, user, currency, location, and language. This involved both backend router creation, frontend context provisioning, and extensive documentation. The work concluded with comprehensive testing, confirming the Luxury Super-App status and addressing URL access issues. The user then confirmed to keep the development environment stable for further work.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts is envisioned as a B2C/B2B Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform for Series A investment, emphasizing an AI-centric, premium user experience. Initial features included AI recommendations, persistent carts, and a cinematic onboarding process. Subsequent phases added lifestyle categories, a social Shop the Look feed, AI Mood-to-Cart™, Creator Tools, Live Commerce, Vendor Onboarding, a Private Beta Cohort, North-Star Dashboard, and Viral Growth Challenges. A primary focus was the Luxury Communication Suite, encompassing Direct Messaging (1:1/group, encryption, real-time, push notifications), Calling System (voice/video, call-to-cart), Channels & Broadcast, Classifieds, LiveSale (scheduled streams with product drops), and Leads (business sales funnel). The latest directive involved transforming AisleMarts into a self-aware, context-aware, and adaptive system—dynamically adjusting to time, user, currency, location, and language for real-time personalization, culminating in a Super-App ready for global deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the full deployment and validation of the AisleMarts Awareness Engine. This involved creating a new backend router () to handle multi-dimensional context detection (time, user, currency, location, language, device) and adaptive responses. On the frontend, a new  was created to provide a global React Context for accessing awareness data, which was then integrated into the root application layout ().

The engineer also generated comprehensive documentation files related to the Awareness Engine: , , , , and . Further production-related documentation ( and ) and a new  component were created.

After implementing and integrating these features, a final comprehensive testing phase was executed, which confirmed an 83.1% success rate (123/148 tests), validating the Awareness Engine, Communication Suite, Advanced AI Features, Global Commerce Platform, and Performance/Security. The application has achieved Luxury Commerce Super-App status, capable of adapting to various user contexts. The main application URL  was confirmed to be accessible, and persistent DNS resolution errors for an incorrect URL () were addressed. The user explicitly stated to keep dev, indicating the current environment should be maintained for further iteration.
