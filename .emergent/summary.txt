The AI engineer's work involved an iterative evolution of the AisleMarts Super-App. Initially focusing on a TikTok-style feed, the trajectory shifted to a Series A-ready social commerce platform, encompassing Infinity Stories, UX/Performance, and Commerce Layer integration. Significant effort was dedicated to production hardening, addressing analytics, API error handling, multi-currency support, and security.

The core of the recent work involved integrating an Ultimate Operational Kit and later a Triple Store Launch Kit, which included robust backend middleware, database scripts, comprehensive test suites, and multi-platform deployment capabilities. Key challenges encountered and resolved involved correcting the Express.js server's root endpoint handling, resolving backend/frontend port conflicts, fixing TypeScript syntax errors in frontend logging, and gracefully handling missing dynamic imports in the push notification bridge. The current state reflects a fully integrated and validated system, prepared for final hardening and app store submissions.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts is an AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem aiming for 0% commission, pay-per-lead, TikTok-inspired social commerce, and gamified rewards. The previous AI engineer was tasked with developing an irresistible super app with AI analytics, monetization, and personalization, specifically targeting Series A readiness.

Key requirements and implementations so far include:
*   **AisleMarts Stories System (Phases 1-3):** Implemented Instagram-style stories with 7 header icons, synchronous scrolling, full-screen video, time-based expiry, dynamic story types, viewed/unviewed rings, dynamic creator order, tap/hold/swipe mechanics, and commerce integration via swipe-up. This evolved into an Infinity Content Engine with virtual scrolling, content preloading, cursor-based pagination, and memory management (75MB LRU cache). An Infinity Commerce Layer provides backend models for tracking impressions, CTAs, purchases, and commission calculation with attribution.
*   **Production Hardening:** Addressed attribution edge cases, commission accuracy, idempotency/replay protection, load testing, mobile UX stress, analytics correctness, security (HMAC), proper 4xx API responses, and multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY with rounding and FX normalization).
*   **Deployment & Operational Readiness:** Integration of an Ultimate Operational Kit (backend middleware, SQL scripts, testing tools, Docker) and a Triple Store Launch Kit (EAS profiles, Android Gradle patches, iOS Info.plist keys, push bridge, deep links, preload coordinator, store listing templates, CI workflows).
*   **Frontend Fixes:** Resolved display issues in  and implemented Remix/Repost features. The frontend was also patched to correctly handle the backend's root () endpoint response.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript, , , , , , Detox (E2E testing).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, Express.js (Node.js), Prisma/PostgreSQL, Zod (validation), HMAC security, Idempotency middleware.
-   **Architecture**: Monorepo, API-driven.
-   **UI/UX Patterns**: TikTok-style feeds, Instagram-style stories, responsive design, deep linking.
-   **Ops**: Docker, Makefile, CI/CD, EAS (Expo Application Services).

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI/Express) and  (Expo/React Native).



**Key Files and their importance/changes:**

*   ****: Replaced/created as the main Express backend entry. Integrates all hardening middlewares, validation schemas, and commerce/tracking routes. **Change**: Added a friendly root () endpoint and an improved 404 handler for better client experience. Was running on port 3000, causing conflict with Expo, moved to 8002.
*   ****: Defines PostgreSQL schema, now includes , , , . **Change**: Crucial for multi-currency, attribution, and idempotency.
*   ** (idempotency, hmac, validate, errors)**: New files for robust API security, data integrity, and error handling.
*   ****: Main entry for Expo Router app. **Change**: Integrated  hooks for  (push notifications) and deep link handling (, ). Fixed TypeScript syntax errors in  statements within the deep link handler.
*   ****: Expo Application Services configuration. **Change**: Merged with new , ,  build and submit profiles to support multi-platform deployment.
*   ****: New unified push notification bridge for APNS, FCM, and HMS. **Change**: Modified to handle dynamic imports for messaging SDKs gracefully with  to prevent crashes if a specific SDK is not installed.
*   ****: New utility to detect the mobile runtime environment (iOS, GMS, HMS).
*   ****: New component, a wrapper for  to register its ref and data with the , and automatically assign s for E2E testing.
*   ****: New file defining canonical s for UI elements, used by Detox tests.
*   ****: New utility for parsing incoming deep link URLs.
*   ****: New router function to handle parsed deep links and navigate within the app (e.g., scroll to a specific story).
*   ****: New module to manage  ref and data for stories, enabling programmatic scrolling by story ID.
*   ****: New logic for preloading next stories' media (images/video) to ensure smooth infinite scrolling.
*   ****: New utility to encapsulate  with a  guard, preventing noisy logs in production.
*   ****: New directory containing Detox E2E test configurations and actual test files (e.g., , , , ).
*   ****: New SQL scripts for creating materialized views for analytics integrity, seeding foreign exchange rates, and applying performance indexes.
*   ****: New Node.js clients for testing signed API calls (e.g., , ).
*   ****: New master script to automate the setup, patching, and comprehensive validation of the entire application stack.

<pending_tasks>
All previously identified critical issues (analytics data integrity, proper 4xx API responses, and multi-currency support) have been confirmed as resolved.

The immediate pending tasks are:
*   Apply hardening patches for  utility and robust deep-link effect.
*   Run the 30-minute ship checklist for final functional, deep link, push, resilience, performance, and analytics integrity validation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the final stages of achieving 100% Series A readiness for the AisleMarts application. This involved integrating a comprehensive Go-Live package and addressing critical UI/UX and stability issues.

The AI engineer had successfully integrated:
1.  **Ultimate Operational Kit components:** This included backend middleware, SQL scripts, testing tools, and an Express.js server, which was initially configured to run on port 3000, conflicting with the Expo frontend. This conflict was resolved by moving the Express server to port 8002.
2.  **Frontend Deep Link Handling:** A deep link parser, router, and story registry were introduced, along with a preload coordinator for smooth story viewing.
3.  **Multi-Platform Deployment:** EAS profiles for iOS, Android GMS, and Android HMS builds were merged, and necessary Gradle patches for Android (flavors, Huawei repos) and Info.plist keys for iOS were prepared.
4.  **Detox E2E Test Suite:** A comprehensive suite for frontend testing, including tests for stories tray rendering, swipe navigation, CTA tracking, and deep link launches, was integrated.
5.  **Backend Validation Script:** A master  script was developed and executed to validate the entire backend stack (health, stories, CORS, HMAC, idempotency, multi-currency).

The last reported issue was a frontend red screen caused by a TypeScript syntax error in  (incorrect  syntax) and a subsequent error due to missing Firebase Messaging dependency in the dynamically imported push bridge. Both were fixed by:
*   Quoting the log tags in :
    
*   Wrapping dynamic imports for push notification SDKs in  blocks in  to handle missing dependencies gracefully.

The frontend is now loading successfully without errors. The product is considered fully integrated and working, demonstrating complete global deployment capabilities, and complete investor demonstration readiness.

The user has just provided a 30-minute ship checklist for final validation and two tiny hardening patches ( and a robust deep-link effect in the app entry). The AI engineer's immediate action is to apply these hardening patches.
