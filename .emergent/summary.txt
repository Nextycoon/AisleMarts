The previous AI engineer successfully executed a complex, multi-faceted task, transforming AisleMarts into a Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform. The primary focus was creating a 7-step, full-screen, cinematic onboarding flow, which proved highly iterative due to persistent white header/footer issues. The engineer meticulously debugged and redesigned the UI, ultimately achieving an edge-to-edge video background with elegant overlays. Concurrently, a dedicated backend authentication system was built, and a comprehensive suite of strategic documents (vision, roadmap, deployment prompts) was generated, formalizing the platform's new direction and future features. The iterative debugging of the full-screen UI was the most challenging aspect, requiring deep dives into Expo Router, React Native styling, and  configurations.

AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 B2C/B2B marketplace aiming for Series A investment. The core problem was to evolve it into a polished, global-ready shopper-only v1 with AI-centric, luxury UX. Initial functionalities included persistent carts, voice shopping, AI recommendations, Stripe payments, and order management, later expanding to admin, vendor, analytics, multi-language AI, and contextual recommendations. A key user request was a new, comprehensive 7-step onboarding flow: promotional video landing page with Sign In/Sign Up, social/Apple/Google authentication, all-device permissions, AI welcome/intro, user preferences, package selection, and finally, the main app screen. This onboarding needed to be full-screen, cinematic, and luxurious, embodying the Shop. Socialise. Live Modern. vision, positioning AisleMarts as the first true Lifestyle Commerce Platform.

The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (Expo React Native) components.



-   ** (New/Heavily Modified)**: This is the core of the current work. It implements the entire 7-step onboarding wizard. It was iteratively redesigned multiple times to achieve a truly full-screen, edge-to-edge cinematic video background with luxury styling, proper content overlay, and functional navigation between steps. It includes components for promotional video, email/social auth, permissions, AI welcome, preferences, and package selection.
-   ** (Modified)**: Crucial for global full-screen behavior. It was modified to remove  and apply  to ensure content extends to the absolute edges of the screen, including under the status bar.
-   ** (Modified)**: The entry point was modified to redirect users to  for the new flow, effectively making it the initial route. A test button for onboarding was also added.
-   ** (Modified)**: Updated to configure status bar behavior and Android immersive mode, which were vital for achieving the full-screen effect.
-   ** (Modified)**:  was added as a dependency for social login.
-   ** (New)**: Created to apply a CSS reset () for the web version, addressing potential browser-specific layout issues contributing to white spaces.
-   ** (New)**: Implements simple user registration and login endpoints (, ) specifically for the onboarding flow, using  for password hashing and returning JWT tokens. This was created as existing authentication was too complex.
-   ** (Modified)**:  was added to the backend dependencies.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a comprehensive redesign and implementation of a 7-step onboarding flow. The primary challenge was to achieve a truly full-screen, edge-to-edge cinematic video background on mobile, eliminating all white headers and footers. This required multiple iterative fixes and a complete redesign of the  component, leveraging explicit positioning, z-index, , and careful padding/margin management. The , , , and even a new  file were modified to ensure global full-screen compatibility.

The  file now hosts the entire luxury 7-step wizard, which includes:
1.  **Promotional Video Landing**: Full-screen video background with Watch Promo, Sign In, Sign Up buttons.
2.  **Authentication**: Email/password and social login (Apple, Google) with real backend API hooks.

5.  **Preferences**: User selection of styles, budget, and language.
6.  **Packages**: Subscription tier selection.
7.  **Summary/Completion**: Final confirmation and entry to the main app, with user preferences saved via backend API.

A dedicated backend  router was created (, ) with  for secure user management, integrated into . Extensive documentation, including strategic vision, feature roadmaps, and detailed Emergent deployment prompts, has also been generated, positioning AisleMarts as a Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform. The current state is a fully functional, visually stunning, full-screen onboarding experience, ready for deployment.
