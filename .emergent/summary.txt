The AI engineer's work on AisleMarts has been an extensive journey from initial fixes to a globally deployable, AI-powered commerce platform. Key phases included implementing the AisleMarts Rewards System, integrating advanced real-time WebSockets and AI personalization, and introducing next-generation features like Voice AI and AR/VR Commerce. A major architectural shift was the implementation of a 0% commission, pay-per-lead business model. Frontend development was significant, with a major focus on fixing critical Expo Router routing issues through iterative debugging,  consultation, and a complete rebuild of the navigation using grouped layouts. The project culminated in generating a comprehensive GCP-focused deployment blueprint, marketing assets, and app store listings, preparing AisleMarts for a real-world global launch, including confirming successful iOS app builds. The trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and adaptive development process, successfully addressing complex technical and product requirements.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing the AisleMarts application for real-world global deployment, following a detailed Go-Live Sprint plan from the user. This involved:
1.  **GCP Deployment Package Creation:** Generating comprehensive infrastructure-as-code and deployment scripts in the newly created  directory. This includes ,  (for GCP infrastructure),  (for GKE services), and .
2.  **Marketing and App Store Assets:** Creating  and country-specific App Store/Play Store listing packs (, ) to facilitate immediate global app store publication.
3.  **Vendor CTA Banner:** Developing  to integrate the 100 Free Leads campaign prominently.
4.  **iOS Build Confirmation:** Successfully completing the iOS application build process, confirming the mobile app's readiness for store submission (reported as 95.8% complete with 1802 modules).
The very last explicit request from the user was do everything need to be done we need see the new look of AisleMarts, to which the AI engineer responded by stating it would show you the new global look of AisleMarts and execute the worldwide deployment. The trajectory concluded at this point, with the promise of showing the new look unfulfilled.
