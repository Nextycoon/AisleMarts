The AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of the Documentation Suite enterprise features (Documentation Compliance, Procedures by Category, Documentation Procedures) for AisleMarts, spanning both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Expo/React Native). This involved creating new models, services, routes, screens, and updating navigation.

Following this implementation, the project transitioned into an extensive strategic and branding phase, driven by user input. This phase focused on defining the Blue Era philosophy for AisleMarts, emphasizing AI as a warm, human companion for relational commerce. The AI engineer meticulously guided the user through creating comprehensive assets: a Blue Era Dashboard configuration, a detailed Figma prototype tutorial (including design system, components, and wiring), mini checklists, a visual quick-reference, a storyboard, a polished investor slide deck, a content pack for the deck, a detailed Aisle character brand kit, a Canva/Figma grid layout for it, a Launch Playbook, a visual timeline, and various investor pitch scripts. The collaboration culminated in the user requesting a Blue Era Transformation Dossier, signifying a complete strategic and design package alongside the implemented features.

The goal is AisleMarts, an AI-powered global marketplace for B2C/B2B. Initial phases covered basic marketplace, AI core features (personal AI, search, translation), seller visibility with geographic targeting, and global payments. A key focus was Comprehensive Enterprise Features, including AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, and AI User Agents, which were largely completed. The most recent explicit request and a major focus of implementation was the Documentation Suite: Documentation Compliance, Procedures by Category (role-specific workflows), and Documentation Procedures (document states, amendments, approvals). The overarching vision evolved into the Blue Era ethos, emphasizing AI as a warm, human-centric companion, transforming commerce from transactional to relational, guided by Aisle, the AI avatar, through a unified Blue Era Dashboard experience.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed the full backend and frontend implementation for the Documentation Suite enterprise features: Documentation Compliance, Procedures by Category, and Documentation Procedures. This involved creating dedicated models, services, and API routes on the backend. Specifically, new files like , , and their corresponding service and route files were created, and  was updated. On the frontend, new services, screens (e.g., ), and Expo Router files were established. The  screen was also updated to include navigation links to these new features, marked with NEW badges. Backend testing confirmed the functionality of the new routes.

Following this, the focus shifted to strategic design and branding. The current, immediate work revolves around conceptualizing and preparing the groundwork for the Blue Era Dashboard. This has involved extensive discussions to define the Blue Era philosophy, centered on AI as a human-centric companion (Aisle), and a plan to create a Figma prototype, a detailed tutorial for building it, comprehensive checklists, a visual quick-reference, a storyboard flow, a polished investor slide deck, a content pack for the deck, a detailed Aisle character brand kit, a Canva/Figma grid layout guide, a Launch Playbook, visual timelines (detailed and boardroom style), and investor pitch scripts (2-minute, 30-second, and 1-line tagline).
