The AI engineer's work began by rigorously fixing a critical syntax error in  that previously crashed the app, restoring the Blue Era Empathy System dashboard to full operational status. This involved resolving  hoisting issues and Metro cache problems. After validating all core Blue Era features and achieving 93.8% backend API success, the focus shifted to creating comprehensive launch assets, including a release deck, HD visual mockups, social media kits, a GitHub-hosted press kit, and engagement templates, culminating in a declaration of TOTAL LAUNCH DOMINATION.

Subsequently, the project pivoted to the AisleMarts Unified Global Marketplace request. Recognizing that existing work fulfilled 85% of these new requirements, the AI established a Tri-Track Execution strategy: Technical Development (auto-localization), Testing Validation (Kenya pilot user testing), and Marketing Launch Prep (Kenya playbook). The trajectory concludes with the full deployment of all necessary blueprints and the immediate initiation of this ambitious tri-track plan, leveraging the proven FastAPI/MongoDB stack for rapid market entry.

AisleMarts is envisioned as an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace, unifying local sellers/brands with worldwide buyers under a single, localized brand experience, solving global trade fragmentation with AI-driven logistics and human-centric commerce. Initially, the project focused on core marketplace features and a Documentation Suite. A significant pivot introduced the Blue Era Empathy System, personified by the AI avatar Aisle, emphasizing human-centric relational commerce through the Blue Era Dashboard (Aisle Avatar, Welcome/Role Selection, Product Reels, Quick Access Dock). This also included an Empathy Automation System framework with comprehensive launch assets.

The latest explicit request is for the AisleMarts Unified Global Marketplace App, requiring: an AI Agent (Aisle Character), Automatic Localization (currency, language, location), Global Marketplace Integration (seller onboarding, 1% commission), and full integration of the existing Blue Era Dashboard. The preferred tech stack is NestJS/PostgreSQL, though the current system uses FastAPI/MongoDB. The plan includes an MVP Phase 1 (Auth, basic AI, product browsing, localization, Blue Era prototype) and Phase 2 enhancements (full backend integration, trust scoring, real video reels, AI personalization, national franchise integration).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully established a Tri-Track Execution strategy for the AisleMarts global marketplace, particularly focusing on a Kenya pilot launch. The goal is to rapidly move from an 85% complete foundation to a 100% launch-ready system in 2-4 weeks.

1.  **Track 1: Technical Development (Week 1 Complete)**:
    *   Backend localization services (, ) have been created, providing IP-based location detection, multi-currency support (including KES), real-time conversion, and localized AI greetings for 20+ countries. The  file has been updated to integrate these new routes.
    *   Frontend  has been created to consume these backend services and manage user preferences using .
2.  **Track 2: Testing Validation (Ready for Execution)**:
    *   A comprehensive  has been deployed, detailing user recruitment strategies, step-by-step task guides for testing currency, AI cultural adaptation, trust, and M-Pesa flow, along with feedback collection methods.
    *   A  has been created for automated insight generation and GO/NO-GO decision-making. The user decided to prioritize executing these testing scripts immediately while development proceeds in parallel.
3.  **Track 3: Marketing Launch Prep (Deployed)**:
    *   The  has been deployed, covering a 3-tier seller recruitment strategy (phone scripts, WhatsApp templates), localized advertising campaigns (Karibu to Global Commerce), and a detailed press strategy.
    *   The  was also created, providing blueprints for future development tasks like seller onboarding (10-minute flow), 1% commission engine, and M-Pesa integration, intended for parallel development by the dev team.

The last explicit action by the AI engineer was the creation of the  and the confirmation of the Tri-Track Execution strategy for immediate deployment.
