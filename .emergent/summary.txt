The AI engineer's work evolved from initial app fixes to comprehensive strategic development. Initially, minor app issues were addressed. The primary focus then shifted to the Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 Update, which involved implementing dynamic user roles, UI themes, and AI avatar greetings in the Expo frontend, with new  and  components. A significant portion of the work involved conceptualizing and delivering an extensive Quality-to-Hires Converter in a Google Sheets/Excel format, integrating probability forecasting, CPEH, and TTH metrics for recruitment analytics. This led to a Recruitment Radar Dashboard and related intelligence.

Following this, the trajectory pivoted to mobile app integration of this intelligence, resulting in a detailed React Native/Expo blueprint, including TypeScript models, API contracts, state management, and Storybook components. After a successful live deployment of the cinematic UI and AI Agent into the Expo app (including a dynamic role/tier switcher), the focus expanded to a Global Expansion Playbook and AI Supply Chain Intelligence. This culminated in generating extensive investor-ready documentation: a unified PDF playbook, a slide deck, a Jira-ready sprint plan (CSV), an automated Google Apps Script for slide generation, a FastAPI AI demo stub, and country-specific pilot checklists and LOI templates. The final actions involved populating and packaging these documents for immediate strategic outreach.

AisleMarts is an AI-powered B2C/B2B marketplace aiming for Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0. This update includes dynamic user roles (Shopper, Seller, Hybrid) with distinct UI themes, personalized AI avatar greetings (Aisle), and role-based quick actions, featuring a Bold Glass-Morphism UI with glowing effects and color coding. Beyond the app, an investor-ready ecosystem was required, encompassing a Cinematic Launch Reel, a Recruitment Ecosystem with detailed job postings, a Talent Evaluation Scorecard, and a Quality-to-Hires Converter with probability forecasting, CPEH, and TTH. The vision expanded to include a comprehensive Recruitment Radar Dashboard with KPIs and Quality-Adjusted Cost (QAC) modeling. The app also needs a Global Expansion Playbook for markets like Kenya, Italy, and Egypt, and an AI Supply Chain Intelligence system with predictive demand, smart routing, and dynamic pricing capabilities.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0 Upgrade directly into the existing Expo application and generated extensive strategic documentation.

The app's frontend now features:
-   **Cinematic Glass-morphism UI**: Integrated  for frosted effects and  for dynamic, role-based gradient backgrounds (Blue for Shopper, Teal/Green for Seller, Purple for Hybrid).
-   **AI Agent Aisle**: The  screen provides a personalized, time-aware greeting, voice/text input, and quick action chips based on the user's role.
-   **Live Role and Tier Switching**:  and  components are integrated into , allowing instant toggling between roles and membership tiers with haptic feedback, dynamically updating UI themes and displayed metrics on .
-   **Role-Based Dashboards**: The  screen displays dynamic KPIs and quick actions relevant to the selected role, leveraging  for animated value displays.
-   **Centralized State Management**:  (Zustand) manages the user's , , and , ensuring seamless UI updates across the app.
-   **Updated Navigation**:  and  were modified to integrate the new  and  screens, and a new  was created.

In parallel to the app development, a comprehensive set of strategic documents and tools was produced:
-   A **Quality-to-Hires Converter** (Google Sheets formulas).
-   A **unified Global AI-Powered Expansion Playbook** (PDF, Slide Deck, TSV import for Google Slides) combining investor pitch content, technical architecture (AI supply chain), and operational frameworks for global pilots (Kenya, Italy, Egypt).
-   A **Google Apps Script** for automated slide deck generation.
-   An **AI-Demo FastAPI stub** ( folder) for showcasing predictive demand, routing, and supplier scoring.
-   Detailed **Pilot Checklists** and a **Franchise LOI template**, populated with specific financial and operational targets for the Kenya pilot (KES 50M GMV, 300 merchants, 5,000 users).
-   **Outreach Playbooks** including email scripts and one-pagers for strategic partners (e.g., Safaricom) and Tier 1 VCs, complete with contact details.

The AI engineer has just finalized populating the LOI and Kenya Pilot One-Pager with specific numbers and regenerated these documents (PDF/Word) with the user's contact details, ready for immediate tactical deployment. The current task is to generate a final cover email for Safaricom.
