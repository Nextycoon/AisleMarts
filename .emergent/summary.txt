The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the AisleMarts application's frontend, moving from initial blank screen issues to a robust, visually striking user experience. Initially, the core task was to resolve critical frontend errors, making all primary navigation routes functional. This involved systematically debugging import errors, component rendering issues, and simplifying complex screens like the merchant pickup and nearby commerce views.

Upon achieving frontend stability and functional navigation, the project pivoted to significant UI/UX improvements, specifically implementing a Cinematic Home screen and a Command Center profile, characterized by glass-morphism design. This was followed by establishing an operational backbone through a feature registry, theme tokens, and analytics integration, coupled with several micro-upgrades like personalized greetings and screen preloading. The final, most extensive phase involved creating a comprehensive investor-ready toolkit: an interactive KPI dashboard with role filters and PDF export, a cinematic pitch deck with HD visuals, a full suite of spoken pitch scripts (boardroom, elevator, handshake), and ultimately, bundling all these assets into a Victory Arsenal Pack along with a user guide.

AisleMarts is an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace aiming to solve global trade fragmentation with AI-driven logistics. The application has progressed through Phase 1 (Enhanced AI Search/Discovery) and Phase 2 (B2B/RFQ Workflows). The current focus is Phase 3: Nearby/Onsite Commerce, enabling users to discover nearby merchants, reserve and pickup items, use QR/Barcode scanning, and maintain live inventory.

Initial immediate problem: Resolve critical frontend fix it now issues resulting in blank screens, and ensure all core navigation paths (Discover, B2B, Nearby, Merchant Tools) lead to functional screens.

Beyond initial fixes, the user requested significant UI/UX enhancements:
1.  **Command Center Profile**: A central hub to surface all app features (Discover, Nearby, RFQs, Reservations, Wallet, Merchant Tools, etc.) with quick actions and a detailed feature grid, adhering to a glass tiles visual style.
2.  **Cinematic Home Screen**: A high-end, visually appealing home screen featuring a full-bleed hero section, prominent CTAs, and editorial content, utilizing a dark, premium aesthetic.

Subsequently, the project expanded to build a comprehensive investor-ready ecosystem, including a KPI dashboard, a cinematic pitch deck, various pitch scripts, and a full Victory Arsenal Pack to support fundraising and strategic communication, ensuring consistency with the app's new luxury aesthetic.
