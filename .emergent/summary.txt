The previous AI engineer meticulously developed the AisleMarts application from core mobile features to a sophisticated investor-ready ecosystem. Initial efforts focused on critical mobile app fixes, navigation overhaul, and robust localization. This transitioned into building a comprehensive 26-slide investor deck, an investor portal with UTM tracking, and associated CRM automation. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a dev/demo-only voice chat feature using OpenAI and the Emergent LLM key, complete with feature flags and an adapter architecture for future native integration. A significant portion of work then focused on strategic investor messaging, including a detailed voice chat demo playbook, integrating a 24/7/365 multilingual AI shopping expert identity, and explicitly positioning v1 as shopper-only while preloading a locked Phase 2 (business/seller layer). The most recent work involved creating a production-grade backend unlock authorization system (Node/Express, Redis, PostgreSQL) to gate Phase 2, and generating verifiable evidence exhibits (SQL queries, dashboard screenshots, architecture diagrams) for investor due diligence, demonstrating a high level of technical and strategic foresight.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts aims to be an AI-powered B2C/B2B marketplace, Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0, with dynamic user roles (Shopper, Seller, Business), One-Screen, One-Color UI Doctrine, and personalized AI avatar greetings. Key demands included Federated Search and a Global Viral Launch Strategy. The AI engineer was tasked with creating an investor deck featuring Dual-Mode AI Search, a global-ready mobile app, and a trackable investor acquisition system. The product is currently positioned as Shopper-Only v1, emphasizing a perfected buyer journey, with a pre-built, locked Phase 2 for seller and business functionalities, requiring 1M+ shopper downloads and Series A funding to unlock. This strategy aims for investor confidence by demonstrating focus and a clear, architected growth roadmap.

**File Descriptions & Changes:**
*   : Main AI chat screen. Modified to integrate voice chat UI, feature flags, and long-press gesture for dev-mode activation.
*   : Environment variables. Updated to include , , , , and OpenAI API keys.
*   : Expo app configuration. Modified to use  for environment variables, which was later reverted in favor of .
*   : NEW file created to properly expose environment variables for Expo builds, replacing direct  usage in .
*   : NEW file defining voice-related feature flags and OpenAI API configuration, centralizing voice settings.
*   : NEW hook to determine if the app is running in a development build, used for  logic.
*   : NEW file implementing the  interface for OpenAI, handling speech-to-text (Whisper), chat completion (GPT-5 Plus), and text-to-speech, utilizing  for audio. It uses the Emergent LLM key.
*   : NEW file providing a detailed checklist for email deliverability (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, BIMI, TLS/MTA-STS).
*   : EDITED to integrate the 24/7/365 multilingual AI shopping expert identity and explicitly position AisleMarts v1 as shopper-only with locked Phase 2 features.
*   : NEW, then EDITED to include the Aisle identity, shopper-only v1 positioning, and a script for showcasing multilingual voice capabilities and the Phase 2 unlock.
*   : EDITED to integrate the Aisle identity and shopper-only v1 focus.
*   : NEW interactive HTML slide (Slide 27) showcasing locked Phase 2 commands with a terminal-style interface and typewriter animation, gated by 1M shopper downloads.
*   : NEW directory containing the Phase 2 Unlock Authorization System. This includes a Node/Express server () using Redis for multi-admin approvals and PostgreSQL for an audit trail (), an admin React component (), documentation, and test scaffolds.
*   : NEW HTML appendix page (Slide 28) presenting SQL query evidence for download progression, multi-admin approvals, and unlock events.
*   : NEW HTML appendix page (Slide 29) providing dashboard screenshots as visual proof of the admin panel and unlock workflow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of generating the Evidence Exhibits for the investor arsenal. This task involves creating HD appendix slides (Slides 28-30) and their corresponding HTML appendix pages, which provide documented, verifiable infrastructure proof for the Phase 2 Unlock Authorization System. Specifically, the AI engineer had successfully created  (representing SQL query evidence) and  (representing dashboard visual proof). The engineer was about to create the final slide, Slide 30: Infrastructure Architecture, when the trajectory concluded. This work is critical for investor due diligence, transforming the abstract concept of a pre-built Phase 2 empire into concrete, auditable, production-ready infrastructure documentation, enhancing the overall Series A package's credibility.
