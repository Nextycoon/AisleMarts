<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates an iterative development process for the AisleMarts application. Initially, it involved implementing and validating the BlueWave Family-Safe AI-Powered Commerce Platform, including core systems, security (E2EE/KMS), and a 7-tab navigation. Following this, the user pivoted to integrate TikTok-inspired features, which the AI engineer implemented, creating new frontend screens and backend routes for social commerce. Finally, the project evolved into a unified AI marketplace vision, incorporating an Aisle AI service for automated vendor outreach and a comprehensive lifestyle ecosystem frontend. The AI engineer consistently addressed user pivots, debugged issues, and performed backend/frontend testing, culminating in detailed modular prompts for future development.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts evolved from a Luxury Lifestyle Commerce Platform for Series A to BlueWave AisleMarts, a Family-Safe AI-Powered Commerce Platform. Initial core requirements included Investor Demo, Global Localization (Currency/Language-Infinity), Universal Commerce AI Hub, Go-Live Readiness (A/B testing, monitoring), and Enhanced Security (E2EE/KMS). The platform introduced a 7-tab bottom navigation (Home, Friends, Cart, Add, Inbox, Aisle, Profile), a Business (Stars) Console, and the BlueWave Family, Safety & Wellbeing System (screen time, pairing, parental controls).

A significant pivot introduced TikTok-inspired social commerce: Home (For You) infinite video feed, Explore (Aisle) grid discovery, Creator/Business Studio with product pinning, Live Shopping with in-video checkout, engagement-driven recommendations, social features (likes, comments, shares), and various monetization models. The latest evolution focuses on AisleMarts as a unified AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem with Aisle AI as a smart companion for shoppers and automated vendor outreach, offering a frictionless, lifestyle-driven shopping journey with deep integration of AI for localization, recommendations, and business growth.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had completed the full implementation of the TikTok-inspired BlueWave AisleMarts platform and further evolved it into a unified AI marketplace. This involved developing an Aisle AI service to automate vendor outreach and integrating it into the backend. New frontend screens for a lifestyle ecosystem () and an AI marketplace () were created. The  and  files were created and integrated. However, the very last action indicates that there is a small import error in the  that needs to be fixed before the final comprehensive system test can be conducted.
