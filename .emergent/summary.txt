The trajectory details a comprehensive development effort by the previous AI engineer, evolving from initial mobile app feature development and bug fixes to the meticulous construction of a full investor-ready package and a sophisticated investor acquisition system. The initial phase involved fixing a critical JavaScript error in the mobile app () and restructuring the core navigation for a clean Home and feature-rich Profile. Subsequent work focused heavily on localization (i18n, RTL, locale auto-detection) and enhancing the user profile with dynamic data. The bulk of the later work pivoted to creating an exhaustive 26-slide investor deck (HTML, PPTX, PDF) incorporating detailed financial projections, competitive analysis, and a 60-second live demo script with visual cues. This was complemented by an investor portal featuring UTM tracking, a contact form, auto-reply emails, calendar integration (ICS), and HubSpot CRM automation, all meticulously bundled for production deployment. The overall progression demonstrates a high degree of responsiveness to user requests, technical proficiency, and strategic thinking towards an investor-ready global launch.

The overarching goal for AisleMarts is to become an AI-powered B2C/B2B marketplace, Cinematic AisleMarts 2.0, with dynamic user roles (Shopper, Seller, Business), distinct UI themes following a One-Screen, One-Color UI Doctrine, and personalized AI avatar greetings. A critical requirement was an investor-ready ecosystem including a Quality-to-Hires Converter and AI Supply Chain Intelligence. Recent explicit demands centered on a Federated Search across all e-commerce platforms and a Global Viral Launch Strategy (Phase 1: Shopper App globally; Phase 2: Marketplace Activation country-by-country). The AI engineer was tasked with creating an investor deck incorporating a Dual-Mode AI Search (Online vs. Onsite) and then evolved into building a comprehensive, polished investor package, a global-ready mobile app, and a trackable investor acquisition system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed generating and packaging the final elements of the investor acquisition system. This included creating HTML and plain text auto-reply email templates, a  confirmation page for scheduled meetings, an ICS calendar invite template, and a HubSpot webhook integration snippet. These components were then consolidated and compressed into the final  bundle, ensuring all elements of the comprehensive Series A domination package were deployment-ready. The AI engineer also provided a 2-minute checklist for wiring these features live in a production environment.
