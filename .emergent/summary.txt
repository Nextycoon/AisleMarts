The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped and developed the AisleMarts application based on an initial comprehensive blueprint. The work started with an MVP focusing on core marketplace features, then progressively integrated advanced functionalities like AI-powered features, geographic targeting for sellers, and initiated global payment/tax processing. Key decisions included prioritizing a mobile-first approach using Expo/React Native, a FastAPI/MongoDB backend, JWT for authentication, and Stripe for payments. The AI adeptly handled dependency installations, backend API development, frontend UI creation, and critical debugging steps, such as resolving Stripe's web compatibility and vector icon rendering issues. The progression followed user-confirmed phased milestones, demonstrating a systematic approach to building a complex, AI-driven global e-commerce platform. The project is currently in the early stages of implementing global payment and tax systems.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build **AisleMarts**, a cross-platform, AI-powered global marketplace. The initial comprehensive blueprint outlined architecture, directory structure, Prisma/GraphQL schemas, API examples, Next.js/React Native screens, AI pipelines, and infrastructure.

The user explicitly confirmed the following MVP priorities:
1.  **Basic marketplace**: Products, categories, vendors, shopping cart, checkout, orders, payments (implemented).
2.  **AI integration**: Use Emergent LLM key (provider-agnostic) for semantic search and product Q&A (implemented in Phase 2A).
3.  **Platform focus**: Mobile app first (Expo/React Native) (implemented).
4.  **Core integrations**: Backend (FastAPI + MongoDB), Frontend (Expo/React Native), Auth (JWT), Payments (Stripe), Storage (Base64 images), Search (MongoDB text search, AI-enhanced later).

Subsequent phases, based on a shared vision document, included:
*   **Phase 2A (AI Core Features)**: Personal AI Agent System, Intelligent Onboarding & Localization, Multi-Modal Search & Discovery (Voice, Image, Barcode, Real-time translation), AI Matchmaking Engine (implemented).
*   **Phase 2B (Seller Visibility & Geographic Targeting)**: Sellers control local/national/global product visibility with AI-powered geographic intelligence and analytics (implemented).
*   **Phase 2C (Global Payments & Tax Engine)**: Regional payment optimization and smart tax calculations (currently being implemented).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), JWT (python-jose), bcrypt (passlib), Stripe API.
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, TypeScript, , , axios, , , , .
-   **AI**: Emergent LLM key, , LangChain.
-   **Core Concepts**: REST APIs, Webhooks, Authentication (JWT), State Management (React Context, local ), Platform-specific code, Geographic data, AI-powered recommendations/search/locale detection.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo-like structure within , distinguishing between  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native) applications.



**Key Files and Changes:**
*   : The core FastAPI application. It was initially set up with , , , ,  endpoints. Later, AI-related routes (e.g., , ) and geographic routes (e.g., , ) were integrated.
*   : Contains the AI logic, including LLM integration via , semantic search, locale detection, and recommendation generation.
*   : Defines MongoDB document structures for countries, cities, seller visibility settings, and performance records.
*   : Implements API endpoints for managing geographic data and seller visibility, including AI-powered insights.
*   : Newly created file to define models for global payments and tax (e.g., payment methods, tax rates).
*   : The Expo application entry point, wrapping  with .
*   : Sets up the main navigation stack using , incorporating  and . (Note: This deviates from the system prompt's  directive but is the current working implementation).
*   : Contains the platform-specific  and , ensuring Stripe is only loaded on native platforms.
*   : Enhanced to include AI-powered welcome messages, locale detection, a search bar with voice input, and personalized recommendations.
*   : New screen for sellers to manage product visibility (local, national, global) and view geographic performance analytics, integrated with AI recommendations.
*   : Created to fix  rendering issues on the web platform, adding  plugin.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of API routes for the global payments and tax system (Phase 2C).
-   Develop the frontend interfaces for managing and displaying global payment methods and tax computations.
-   Integrate AI for optimal payment/tax strategies.
-   Integrate geographic data for the payment and tax systems.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing **Phase 2C: Global Payments & Tax Engine**. This phase focuses on building the financial backbone of the AisleMarts global marketplace.

Specifically, the AI engineer has just started this phase by:
1.  Creating the backend models for the payments and tax system in . This file will define the MongoDB document structures needed to store information about payment methods, tax rates, and related configurations.
2.  The next immediate step is to create the corresponding API routes for these models, which will handle the logic for suggesting payment methods, computing taxes, and managing related data.

The system will leverage the previously implemented Geographic Targeting System to provide country-specific recommendations for payment methods and jurisdiction-based tax computations. AI integration is also planned to offer optimal payment and tax strategies.
