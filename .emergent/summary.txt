The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of integrating a new  into an existing P0-P2 hardened, performant, and AI-driven AisleMarts application. Initial tasks focused on wiring event tracking, implementing feature flags, and setting up performance checks. The process involved extensive debugging, addressing TypeScript errors, resolving Expo Go connectivity issues (tunnel setup), and fixing app loading problems by simplifying . The engineer then engaged in multiple UI/UX iterations based on user feedback, refining the landing page messages, removing testing elements, adding 7 creator-specific icons, implementing Amazon-style marketplace and Alibaba-style business sections, and ensuring auto-navigation to the For You feed. The work culminated in documenting the project and awaiting verification of the integrated features, especially for the For You feed in light of a detailed comparison with TikTok.

<product_requirements>
AisleMarts aims to be an AI-powered global marketplace and lifestyle ecosystem, offering 0% commission, pay-per-lead, TikTok-inspired social commerce, and gamified rewards. The core problem is enabling frictionless global trade and social commerce.

Implemented features include:
1.  **Vertical Stories Feed**: A TikTok/Reels-style experience with full-screen video, auto-play, swipe navigation, 7 creator-specific icons, and integrated event tracking for impressions and commerce actions.
2.  **AI Recommendations (P2)**: Hybrid client-server UCB1 algorithm with creator fairness, A/B bucketing, and an ETL pipeline for story statistics.
3.  **Performance & Resilience (P1)**: Zero-jank ,  with , video preloading, offline event queue, and .
4.  **Backend Hardening (P0)**: HMAC authentication, idempotency, multi-currency support, and precise 4xx error responses.
5.  **Modular Marketplace**: Integration of an Amazon-style general marketplace and an Alibaba-style B2B Business section, both with AisleMarts features and specific icons.
6.  **Dynamic Landing Page**: A customizable loading screen with brand messaging (AisleMarts - Connecting Global Commerce, Luxury Shopping Experience), progress indicators, and auto-navigation to the For You feed.

**Summary of why files are important/changed:**
*   : **Modified** to manage tab navigation dynamically based on feature flags, include new , , and  tabs. It also initializes the offline event queue.
*   : **Modified** to define the structure of the tab navigator, routing to  or fallback, and including newly created marketplace and business tabs.
*   : **Heavily modified** multiple times. Initially, simplified to bypass complex loading logic for debugging. Later, restored to a full app loading experience with dynamic brand messages, and auto-navigation to the For You feed, bypassing manual navigation. This file is central to the application's initial user experience and navigation flow.
*   : **Modified** to integrate P0-P2 features like event tracking, ranker hook, media prefetch, and performance HUD. Crucially, it was updated to include **7 creator-specific icons** on the right side of each story reel, and adjusted for correct  component usage and  imports.
*   : **Examined** and confirmed to be already functioning as a video reels feed with auto-play and swipe navigation.
*   : **NEW** file defining the UI for an Amazon-style e-commerce marketplace.
*   : **NEW** file defining the UI for an Alibaba-style B2B business marketplace.
*   : **NEW** tab route file, re-exporting  for navigation.
*   : **NEW** tab route file for the Amazon-style marketplace.
*   : **NEW** tab route file for the Alibaba-style business section.
*   : **Modified** to provide robust tracking functions (, , ) leveraging the offline .
*   : **Modified** to adapt the  interface to use  and ensure compatibility with .
*   : **Modified** to add a default export and fix  usage.
*   : **Modified** to fix a TypeScript error related to a JSX closing tag.
*   : **Modified** to include feature flags (, , , ).

<pending_tasks>
All explicit implementation tasks outlined at the beginning of the trajectory (integrate , wire events, implement feature flags, performance checks, PR-ready patch set) have been addressed and implemented. There are no new *implementation* tasks explicitly requested by the user in the latest messages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user provided a detailed TikTok ForYou Feed vs AisleMarts ForYou Feed Comparison document. This document outlines the enhanced features of AisleMarts' ForYou feed compared to TikTok, emphasizing e-commerce integration, commerce-driven ranking, enhanced social actions, creator tools, one-tap checkout, notifications, rewards, and tiered vendor badges.

Following this, the user explicitly instructed: Restart and refresh, and ensure that the changes have been applied.

The AI engineer's current work involves performing a comprehensive restart and refresh of all backend and frontend services. This action aims to ensure that all previously implemented features, including the  integration, the Amazon-style marketplace (), the Alibaba-style business section (), the refined landing page messaging, the auto-navigation flow, and the 7 creator-specific icons, are correctly reflected and operational in the live application environment. This is a verification step to confirm the application's current state aligns with the user's latest expectations and the detailed feature comparison provided.
