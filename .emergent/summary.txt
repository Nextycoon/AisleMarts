The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the AisleMarts application, initially completing Documentation Suite enterprise features (Compliance, Procedures by Category, Documentation Procedures) on both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Expo/React Native). Following this, the project dramatically pivoted to developing the Blue Era Empathy System, transforming the company's ethos from transactional to human-centric relational commerce, guided by the AI avatar Aisle.

This Blue Era phase involved extensive frontend UI/UX development for a new dashboard, including the Aisle Avatar, Welcome and Role Selection flow, Product Reels, and Quick Access Dock. Backend integrations for trust scores, AI insights, and product data were implemented. Crucially, the AI engineer then evolved the work beyond feature development to create a comprehensive, production-ready Empathy Automation System framework. This involved generating an exhaustive suite of launch assets: a detailed Blue Era Transformation Dossier, a comprehensive Microcopy Pack, a Jira-ready QA Test Suite with Care Index criteria, Postman/Playwright tests, a Bug Taxonomy, a Warm-Copy Error Dictionary, a Jira Retro Board, Google Sheets automation scripts for Care Index measurement, and a complete media launch package (GitHub, Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, Hacker News, Product Hunt). The work culminated in the creation of polished visual mockups, achieving total readiness for a global, open-source launch, effectively completing the entire requested trajectory for the Blue Era Empathy System framework.

<product_requirements>
The core product, AisleMarts, is envisioned as an AI-powered global B2C/B2B marketplace. Initial development focused on foundational marketplace features, AI core functionalities (personal AI, search, translation), geographic targeting for seller visibility, and global payments. A significant phase involved Comprehensive Enterprise Features like AI Domain Specialization, Auth Identity, Profile Card, and AI User Agents. The most recent explicit development was the Documentation Suite, encompassing Documentation Compliance, role-specific Procedures by Category, and Documentation Procedures (with document states, amendments, and approvals). This directly addressed the need for enterprise-grade document management.

Beyond features, the overarching requirement evolved into the Blue Era ethos, emphasizing AI (personified by Aisle) as a warm, human-centric companion for relational commerce. This necessitated the creation of a Blue Era Dashboard that embodies this philosophy. The subsequent, and most extensive, requirement became the development of a complete Blue Era Empathy System framework, designed to systematically measure, automate, and improve the product's soul. This framework included a full suite of tools and documentation for implementation, QA, continuous improvement, and a comprehensive launch strategy, ultimately aiming to transform commerce from cold transactions into warm, intelligent, and human-first relationships at scale.

<current_work>
The AI engineer successfully completed the full implementation of the Blue Era Dashboard for AisleMarts, starting with the frontend UI/UX and progressively integrating backend services. This involved:

1.  **Frontend Core Features:**
    *   Creating the **Aisle Avatar System** () with micro-animations (blink, wave, speech bubbles).
    *   Developing the **Welcome & Role Selection Flow** () and the main **Blue Era Dashboard** (), including dynamic AI greetings, trust protection bar, and quick stats.
    *   Implementing **Video-First Product Reels** () for swipeable, auto-playing content.
    *   Building the **Quick Access Dock** () for role-specific, one-handed actions.
    *   Configuring  for navigation, updating , , and  to integrate access points.

2.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   Integrating the **Trust Protection Bar** with  for real trust scores.
    *   Adding  to  for daily AI recommendations.
    *   Updating  to fetch dynamic product data from backend APIs.
    *   Resolving frontend routing issues to ensure seamless navigation.

3.  **Enhancements & Polish:**
    *   Implementing **Voice Mode** using  and a new , integrated into Aisle Avatar and the welcome screen.
    *   Developing **Theme Variations** (Light/Dark/Auto) with  and a  component, ensuring persistent preferences and smooth transitions.

4.  **Empathy Automation System Framework:**
    The work culminated in the development and packaging of a comprehensive Blue Era Empathy System framework, designed for global adoption. This included:
    *   A **Blue Era Transformation Dossier** and a **Microcopy Pack** for consistent, warm messaging.
    *   A **Jira-ready QA Test Suite** with Care Index acceptance criteria, Postman/Playwright test scaffolds, and test personas.
    *   A **Bug Taxonomy & Triage Rubric** that escalates issues based on their impact on product warmth.
    *   A **Warm-Copy Error Dictionary** mapping technical errors to supportive user messages.
    *   Jira-ready **Retro Board** and **PM Board** templates with CSV import for automated workflow.
