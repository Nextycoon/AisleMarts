Subject: Strategic Partnership Proposal â€” AisleMarts Kenya Pilot with Safaricom

Dear Safaricom Partnerships Team,

I am reaching out on behalf of AisleMarts, an AI-powered global marketplace platform, to propose a strategic partnership with Safaricom for our upcoming Kenya Pilot Program.

We believe that aligning AisleMarts with Safaricom's unparalleled M-Pesa ecosystem and nationwide market reach creates a unique opportunity to accelerate digital commerce in Kenya.

Pilot Highlights (90 Days):
â€¢ GMV Target: KES 50,000,000 (~$350,000 USD)
â€¢ Merchant Onboarding: 300 verified merchants
â€¢ User Growth: 5,000 active users
â€¢ Conversion Improvement: +12% uplift vs baseline
â€¢ CAC Target: KES 500 (~$3.50 USD)

Our detailed Letter of Intent and Pilot Proposal One-Pager are attached for your review. Together, they outline the financial model, execution roadmap, and mutual benefits of collaboration â€” particularly through M-Pesa integration and co-marketing opportunities that leverage Safaricom's strong presence in Kenya's digital economy.

Next Steps:
1. Review the attached Kenya Pilot Package (LOI + Proposal).
2. Confirm Safaricom's interest in co-leading this pilot initiative.
3. Schedule a call this week to finalize partnership terms and pilot kickoff.

We are targeting a pilot launch within 30 days, and your confirmation this week would allow us to align resources and move forward with speed.

I look forward to your response and to building a partnership that brings digital commerce innovation to Kenya at scale.

Best regards,
Zain Elabden
