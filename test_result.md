# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "üéØ‚úÖ LUXURY COMMUNICATION SUITE SCHEMA FIX VALIDATION COMPLETE: Successfully tested and resolved 2 out of 3 critical schema issues that were blocking the communication suite endpoints. MAJOR FIXES ACHIEVED: ‚úÖ Voice/Video Calls System - Schema validation now working correctly, call initiation accepts 'callee_id' parameter, complete call workflow tested (initiate->answer->end), WebSocket signaling endpoints accessible. ‚úÖ Channels & Groups System - Schema validation fixed, channel creation accepts 'type' field correctly, service implementation aligned with Pydantic model, successful channel creation with all metadata. ‚ö†Ô∏è Business LiveSale Management - Routing issue resolved (endpoint now accessible at /api/livesale/biz/livesales), but service implementation has data structure issue with 'sku' field causing HTTP 500 errors during creation. VALIDATION RESULTS: 2/3 critical endpoints fully operational, existing working features (DM, Consumer LiveSale, Business Leads, AI Mood-to-Cart) remain stable. The communication suite is now 85.7% functional with only minor service-level debugging needed for complete LiveSale management functionality."
