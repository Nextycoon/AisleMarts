# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

DETAILED FINDINGS: Direct Messaging system created conversation successfully with proper encryption (AES-256-GCM), WebSocket endpoints accessible, Leads system provides complete Kanban functionality with 5 columns, LiveSale consumer endpoints working correctly.

MAJOR ISSUES: 1) M-Pesa payment simulation/integration endpoints returning 404 errors, 2) Multi-language AI actually working perfectly (Swahili responses successful: 'Habari za asubuhi, Amina!' and 'Hujambo! Karibu AisleMarts') but test validation logic incorrectly flagged as failures, 3) Seller service health reporting currency as 'None' instead of 'KES', 4) Geographic data showing 0 countries instead of Kenya data. P1 CORE FEATURES: 92.9% success rate (13/14 tests) - acceptable performance. PERFORMANCE: Excellent 436ms average response time (target <500ms). URGENT FIXES NEEDED: 1) Fix M-Pesa endpoint routing (/api/mpesa/simulate-payment, /api/mpesa/integration-status), 2) Correct currency reporting in health endpoints, 3) Initialize geographic data with Kenya support, 4) Update test validation logic for multi-language responses.
