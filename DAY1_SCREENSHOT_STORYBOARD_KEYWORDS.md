## 🎨 **SCREENSHOT COMPOSITION BEST PRACTICES**

2. **Supporting Elements** (35% of screen): Secondary UI that provides context  
3. **Negative Space** (25% of screen): Allows focus and prevents clutter

### **Text Overlay Strategy**
**Option A**: No text overlays (clean, minimalist)
**Option B**: Subtle feature callouts with arrows
**Recommendation**: Option A for iOS, Option B for Android

### **Color Psychology**
- **Blue gradients**: Trust, technology, intelligence
- **Purple accents**: Premium, innovation, luxury
