## 🔧 Cache Resolution Protocol Applied
The persistent cache artifact was resolved using the **Nuclear Cache Purge Protocol**:

1. **Process Termination**: Killed all Expo/Metro processes
2. **Filesystem Purge**: Removed .metro-cache, .expo, .next, node_modules/.cache
3. **File Reconstruction**: Rebuilt awarenessContext.ts from scratch with different structure
4. **Service Restart**: Complete supervisor service restart
5. **Environment Validation**: Confirmed FULL_MODE environment variables

## 🎉 Success Metrics
- **Cache Issues**: RESOLVED - No more phantom syntax errors
- **Application Loading**: SUCCESS - Clean boot sequence
- **Mode Transition**: SUCCESS - Safe Mode → Full Mode complete
- **Backend Integration**: SUCCESS - All systems operational
- **User Experience**: SUCCESS - Enhanced UI/UX active

## 🛡️ Rollback Capability
Immediate rollback to Safe Mode available via:
```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_MODE=true
export NEXT_PUBLIC_AWARENESS_ENABLED=false
sudo supervisorctl restart expo
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status
**AisleMarts is now in FULL MODE with complete Awareness Engine integration, ready for Series A investor demonstrations.**
