## ðŸŽ¯ **COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES**

### **Template 1: VC Partner (Initial Contact)**

**Subject**: AisleMarts â€” Universal Commerce AI Hub (Series A, $15M)

Hi [Partner Name],

We've built the first **Universal Commerce AI Hub** that connects 82+ global platforms (Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Shopify + 78 others) through 256 specialized AI agents.

**Production metrics**: 99.9% uptime, 0.008s avg API latency, 87.4% ML accuracy

**Market opportunity**: $4.9T global e-commerce, solving the $890B cross-border fragmentation problem

**Live demo** (12 min) shows:
â€¢ Visual search across all platforms simultaneously
â€¢ Multilingual AI assistant switching languages mid-conversation  
â€¢ Real-time global pricing with cultural adaptation
â€¢ Predictive analytics with executive dashboards

We're raising **$15M Series A** to scale GTM and cement our technical moat toward **$100M ARR**.

Would you be interested in a 12-minute demo next week? I can send our deck and more details.

Best regards,

### **Template 2: Follow-up (One Week Later)**

**Subject**: Re: AisleMarts â€” Universal Commerce AI Hub Demo

Hi [Partner Name],

Following up on the Universal Commerce AI Hub. A few additional data points that might be relevant:

**Recent milestones**:
â€¢ 100% backend test success rate across all 82 platform integrations
â€¢ A/B testing framework showing +43% CTR improvement in personalized recommendations
â€¢ Executive dashboard deployed with real-time KPIs for Series A investors

**Customer traction**: Enterprise pilots with global retailers validating cross-platform intelligence value

**Technical differentiation**: 18-month head start with proprietary AI agents impossible to replicate quickly

The 12-minute demo has been creating "wow moments" with other VCs. Would [Day] at [Time] work for a brief call?

### **Template 3: Warm Introduction Follow-up**

**Subject**: Introduction Follow-up - AisleMarts Universal Commerce AI Hub

Hi [Partner Name],

Thanks to [Introducer Name] for the introduction!

As mentioned, we've built the **first Universal Commerce AI Hub** - connecting ALL global e-commerce platforms under intelligent automation. Think of it as the "operating system" for global commerce.

**Why this matters now**:
â€¢ Cross-border commerce is $890B but completely fragmented
â€¢ Businesses manage 15+ platforms manually with zero intelligence
â€¢ AI adoption is accelerating but lacks universal integration

**What we've built**:
â€¢ 82+ platforms connected with 256 specialized AI agents
â€¢ Production system: 99.9% uptime, 87.4% ML accuracy, 0.008s response time
â€¢ Enterprise customers using for real commerce intelligence

**Series A ask**: $15M to scale globally and build the infrastructure layer for commerce

[Introducer Name] mentioned you're looking at commerce AI opportunities. Would you be interested in a live demo to see what universal commerce intelligence looks like?
