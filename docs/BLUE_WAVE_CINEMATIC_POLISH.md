The question isn't whether this transformation happens â€” it's whether you'll be part of the intelligence revolution or watching from the commodity sidelines."*

### **Demo Day Closing**
**Cinematic**: *"In five years, luxury commerce will be unrecognizable. AI will anticipate desires, creators will orchestrate experiences, and customers will wonder how they ever shopped without intelligence that understands psychology. AisleMarts isn't building this future â€” we're already living it."*

### **One-on-One Meeting Closing**
**Cinematic**: *"Traditional platforms treat luxury customers like mass market consumers with bigger wallets. We treat them like the intelligent, sophisticated individuals they are.
