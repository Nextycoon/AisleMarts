📱 +254 [phone]

PS: We're specifically looking for quality Kenyan businesses like yours to showcase what Kenya has to offer the world! 🇰🇪
```

#### **Phone Call Script (10-minute pitch)**
```
OPENING (30 seconds):
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking my call! I'm [Your name] from AisleMarts. We're launching a new marketplace that's built specifically for Kenyan businesses to sell globally. I'd love to share how it could help [Business Name] in just a few minutes."

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION (1 minute):
"Many businesses we talk to mention challenges with:
- High commission fees on existing platforms (10-15%)
- Complex setup processes that take weeks
- Payment delays and complications
- Limited global reach despite great products

Do any of these sound familiar to your experience?"

SOLUTION PRESENTATION (3 minutes):
"AisleMarts is different because we built it with Kenyan businesses in mind:

1. LOWEST FEES: Only 1% commission vs 10-15% elsewhere
2. INSTANT SETUP: You can be live and selling in under 10 minutes
3. M-PESA READY: Payments come directly to your M-Pesa business account
4. AI POWERED: Our AI assistant 'Aisle' helps customers discover your products
5. GLOBAL REACH: Your products get seen by buyers worldwide, but prices show in their local currency

The result? You focus on your products, we handle the technology."

VALUE DEMONSTRATION (2 minutes):
"Let me give you a quick example:
- You list a KSh 15,000 electronics item
- A customer in UK sees it as £75 automatically
- They buy using their preferred payment method
- You receive KSh 14,850 via M-Pesa (after 1% commission)
- Total time from sale to payment: under 24 hours

Compare that to [competitor] where you'd pay KSh 1,500-2,250 in fees and wait 7-14 days for payment."

INCENTIVE PRESENTATION (1 minute):
"Because we're launching in Kenya next week, I can offer [Business Name]:
- First month completely FREE (no commission at all)
- KSh 5,000 marketing credit to promote your best products
- Free professional photography for your top 5 products
- Personal onboarding session with me to get you set up perfectly"

CLOSING (2 minutes):
"This offer is only available to our first 50 founding sellers, and we're at [current number] right now. 

Would you like to secure your spot? I can get you set up today, and you'll be live by next week when we launch.

The setup literally takes 10 minutes, and you can start with just your best-selling products to test the waters."

OBJECTION HANDLING:
- "Too good to be true": "I understand the skepticism. That's why we offer the first month free - you can try it risk-free and see the results yourself."
- "Too busy": "The setup is just 10 minutes, and after that it runs automatically. You can even start with just 3-5 products."
- "Happy with current platform": "That's great! This isn't about replacing everything - it's about expanding your reach with minimal effort. You can run both simultaneously."
- "Need to think about it": "Of course! Can I send you our seller information pack? If you like what you see, we can chat again tomorrow?"
```

## 📰 **PRESS STRATEGY & MEDIA OUTREACH**

### **NAIROBI MEDIA PRESS RELEASE**

#### **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**HEADLINE**: AisleMarts Launches Kenya's First AI-Powered Global Marketplace with M-Pesa Integration and Swahili Greetings

**NAIROBI, Kenya** – [Date] – AisleMarts today announced the launch of its Kenya operations, bringing the world's first empathy-driven AI marketplace to Kenyan consumers and businesses. The platform uniquely combines global product access with local payment methods, featuring an AI shopping assistant named "Aisle" that greets users in Swahili and automatically displays prices in Kenya Shillings.

**Revolutionizing E-commerce for Kenya**

Unlike traditional international marketplaces that treat Kenya as an afterthought, AisleMarts was designed from the ground up with Kenyan users in mind. The platform automatically detects a user's location and provides:

- **Localized Currency**: All prices displayed in Kenya Shillings with real-time conversion
- **M-Pesa Integration**: Native mobile money payment support from launch day
- **Cultural AI**: "Aisle" shopping assistant greets users with "Karibu!" and understands local context
- **Trust Protection**: Transparent seller verification and buyer protection systems
- **Local + Global**: Kenyan sellers alongside international brands

**Empowering Kenyan Businesses**

The platform launches with a groundbreaking 1% commission structure – significantly lower than the 10-15% charged by traditional marketplaces. This positions AisleMarts as the most seller-friendly platform in the Kenyan market.

"We've watched Kenyan entrepreneurs struggle with high fees and complex international platforms," said [Founder Name], CEO of AisleMarts. "Our 1% commission and M-Pesa integration mean more money in sellers' pockets, faster. We're not just building a marketplace – we're building a bridge between Kenya's incredible businesses and global customers."

**AI That Understands Kenya**

AisleMarts' flagship feature is "Aisle," an AI shopping companion that provides culturally-appropriate assistance. Rather than generic responses, Aisle understands Kenyan shopping patterns, local product preferences, and even incorporates Swahili phrases naturally.

"Technology should feel warm, not cold," added [Technical Lead Name], CTO. "When Aisle greets you with 'Karibu to AisleMarts Kenya!' and shows you products relevant to life in Nairobi or Mombasa, that's not just localization – that's understanding."

**Market Timing and Opportunity**

The launch comes as Kenya's e-commerce market continues rapid growth, with mobile commerce adoption driven by M-Pesa's ubiquity. Recent studies show 96% of Kenyan adults use mobile money services, making M-Pesa integration essential rather than optional for any serious e-commerce platform.

**Launch Details and Availability**

AisleMarts Kenya is available immediately via:
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- **Web Platform**: aislemarts.com
- **Seller Registration**: aislemarts.com/sell-in-kenya

The company is actively recruiting its first 50 founding sellers, offering:
- First month commission-free
- KSh 5,000 marketing credits
- Free professional product photography
- Personal onboarding support

**About AisleMarts**

Founded in 2024, AisleMarts pioneered the concept of "empathy automation" in e-commerce – using AI to make online shopping feel more human and culturally appropriate. The platform has achieved a 93.8% operational success rate across its technical infrastructure and maintains a "Care Index" that measures user satisfaction across five dimensions: Warmth, Trust, Clarity, Delight, and Recovery.

The Kenya launch represents the first market entry in AisleMarts' African expansion strategy, with Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt planned for 2025.

Subject: EXCLUSIVE: Kenya's First AI Marketplace Speaks Swahili + M-Pesa Ready

Hi [Journalist Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out with an exclusive story opportunity that I think would resonate strongly with [Publication] readers.

AisleMarts is launching Kenya's first AI-powered global marketplace next week, and what makes it unique isn't just the technology – it's how they've approached localization.

Instead of treating Kenya as an afterthought, they built an AI shopping assistant that greets users in Swahili ("Karibu!"), automatically shows prices in KSh, and integrates M-Pesa from day one. Their commission structure (1% vs industry standard 10-15%) could significantly disrupt the local e-commerce landscape.

EXCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITY:
I can arrange for you to:
- First interview with the founder about their Kenya strategy
- Live demonstration of the AI assistant responding in Swahili
- Early access to interview founding sellers before public launch
- Behind-the-scenes look at how they achieved 93.8% technical reliability

The story has multiple angles:
- Technology: AI localization and cultural adaptation
- Business: Market disruption through low-commission model  
- Social: Empowering Kenyan SMEs to access global markets
- Innovation: "Empathy automation" in e-commerce

Would you be interested in an exclusive 30-minute briefing call this week? I can also provide all background materials and arrange any additional interviews you'd find valuable.
